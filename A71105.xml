            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>How high the faith and expectations of Gods people of late years have been, as to the accompliſhment of theſe things, is known to many, and what unceſſant prayers have been put up to the Throne of Grace, for the ſame, is beſt known to the Lord. That you are raiſed up this day, to be <hi>the repairers of our breaches,</hi> and <hi>the reſtorers of paths to dwel in,</hi> is (we hope) the long expected, and much looked for fruit of this our faith and prayer; which as it doth cauſe rejoycing within many hearts, ſo hath it fixed the eyes of moſt upon you to obſerve what great thing that is which God by you is about to do for his poor people.</p>
                  <p>Not to teach you (Right Honorable) what is your work, but to declare what that is which the Lord in the age we

                  <p>And now (Right Honorable) God having raiſed you up, and put into your hands ſo great an opportunity, let not the ſame be loſt for want of any improvement which may be made thereof; this is your day to honor God, and ſerve your Generation; let this day ſlip, and it may be hereafter when you would do the thing, you ſhall not have a day to do it.

That nothing done of late years comes as an anſwer of theſe prayers put up whilſt we were in the houſe of bondage, none of you will or can deny: If any thing elſe be wrought which then we prayed not for, it is either a <hi>ſuperabounding of mercy,</hi> beyond what then we were able to aske or think, or a <hi>trial of our faith;</hi> If a <hi>ſuperabounding of mercy,</hi> ſhall we quarrel with God and one another for that? and if a <hi>trial of our faith,</hi> ſhall we think that ſtrange which hath been the ordinary way of Gods diſpenſations towards his in all ages, when he gives forth mercy, then to <hi>try their faith,</hi> and like a company of ſullen Children ſhall we wrangle with our Father, and in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſom fit throw away our bread, becauſe the cruſt is on it? O let it not be told in Neighbor Nations that the God of <hi>England</hi> hath been ſo kind to his people; and Saints in <hi>England</hi> ſo unkind to their Father, and one unto another.</p>
                  <p>Why (O ye Saints) ſhould you not all in this day go hand in hand about your Fathers work? What hinders (unleſs the corruption of your hearts) your being as active for the Lord, and as holy as you will? Why
<pb facs="tcp:56286:5"/>ſhould the great work of the Generation (wherein the cauſe and honor of your Father and Redeemer is ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged) be at a ſtand, whilſt each of you are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on particular deſigns, parties and intereſts? It is from you alone that God expects this ſervice; it is work the world cannot do, nor will God own them in the doing of it; he calls for this from the hands of you his houſhold Servants; neglect it, and he can raiſe up others, even out of holes and corners, which ſhall do the work, when you ſhall be thrown by. When the Jews (once the viſible people of God) neglected Generation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, God threw them by, and brought in the Gentiles; if Gentile-Churches now grafted in prove fruitleſs in this work, God may cut them off, and graft in the Jews again.

The Doctrine of the Reſurrection,</hi> as the Apoſtle was proving and clearing that, for having evidenced <hi>Chriſts Reſurrection</hi> from the teſtimony of many who were Eye-witneſſes of the ſame, who had both ſeen him, and converſed with him after he was riſen, verſ. 31. Hee for the further confirmation thereof, makes uſe of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16.10. who ſeeing beforehand the Reſurrection of Chriſt, ſpake thereof on this wiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption:</hi> Which words, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>could not be underſtood of David,</hi> for they do no way agree to him, who fell on ſleep, was laid unto his Fathers, and ſaw corruption, <hi>but they do moſt fitly agree to this Jeſus,</hi> who was dead, and by the power of God in three dayes raiſed again, and ſo ſaw no corruption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be underſtood of him, and by them his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was Prophetically pointed out many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years before the time.</p>

                  <p>But now there was ſomething Antecedent to <hi>Davids</hi> falling aſleep, very admirable and remarkable in him, which the Apoſtle will by no means let ſlip, but ſets it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, as a thing worthy their imitation, which is, how that <hi>David</hi> before hee fell on ſleep ſerved his own Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by the will of God. <hi>For</hi> David <hi>after he had ſerved his own Generation by the will of God fell on ſleep.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall firſt Paraphraſe upon the words, and then come to my Obſervations from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Served his Generation (i.e.) did the work of his Generation;</hi> What was the <hi>work of his Generation David</hi> applied himſelf unto? he was not an Idler, a Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in his <hi>Generation.

                     <hi>By the will of God.</hi> Theſe words take in the <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>riſe</hi> of <hi>Davids obedience,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of it. The <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>riſe</hi> was <hi>Gods will;</hi> God willed <hi>David</hi> to do the <hi>work of his Generation,</hi> and becauſe God willed him, he did it; he ſerved the <hi>will of God</hi> in ſerving his <hi>Generation,</hi> and therefore ſerved his <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe it was the <hi>will of God.</hi> The <hi>mattor</hi> of <hi>Davids obedience</hi> was not humane inventions, or mens
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56286:8"/>traditions, but ſuch things only, as God did <hi>will,</hi> and call him to do in his <hi>Generation.</hi> The manner of <hi>Davids obedience</hi> was not in what way he liſted, or in humane prudence judged beſt, but in ſuch a way as was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Gods <hi>will</hi> revealed to him; as he did not of his own head frame the matter, ſo did hee not determine of the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> but in both did ſet before him the <hi>will of God,</hi> and act according to that <hi>will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to graſp together all that lies in theſe words, my aim being only at this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That it is an eſpecial duty lying upon the Saints, to attend unto, and be active in the work or works of their Generation.</hi>

                  <p>Gods famous Worthies who have gone before us (whereof <hi>David</hi> here is inſtance) have done thus, whoſe examples (though not in every thing, yet) in theſe things are rules to us, and therefore we ſhould do it; yea, its <hi>the will of God,</hi> this <hi>David</hi> here grounds his obedience upon, which <hi>Will</hi> makes it as well our duty as his, and therefore we ought to do it.</p>

                  <p>Firſt. What <hi>Generation-work</hi> is, and how different from other works.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. <hi>Generation-work is that work, or thoſe works which the way or manner of Gods dispenſations in the age a Saint lives in, calls him unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When either the condition of the Church or people of God, or the tranſactions of God in the <hi>Age</hi> we live in, or the light of that <hi>Age</hi> calls us to ſome ſpecial imployment, we may look upon that <hi>Work</hi> to be the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in the <hi>Work</hi> of our <hi>Generation,</hi> although the matter of the work be no other, then what the word hath laid down, and is commanded in the general, yet the call to the <hi>Work</hi> takes its principal riſe from the way or manner of Gods <hi>diſpenſations</hi> in, or unto that <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> differs from that <hi>Work</hi> which lyes upon a Saint to perform, as he is a Saint, for thoſe <hi>Works</hi> are not limited to any one <hi>Generation,</hi> but are common to all; what I ſtand bound to do as I am a <hi>Saint,</hi> I am alike obliged to do in that reſpect, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Generation</hi> I live; but now the <hi>work</hi> of my <hi>Generation,</hi> I ſtand bound to that by vertue of Gods <hi>diſpenſations</hi> towards the <hi>Age</hi> I live in; in ſuch manner, as that thing which now is my <hi>work</hi> living in this <hi>Age,</hi> did I live in another <hi>Age,</hi> wherein the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of God were after another manner, would not be my <hi>work,</hi> but another thing would be my <hi>work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence likewiſe the <hi>work</hi> out <hi>Generation</hi> is different from the <hi>works</hi> of our <hi>Callings, Staetion, relation,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>condition,</hi> for every of theſe bring their ſeveral <hi>works,</hi> but theſe properly as they are ſuch <hi>(i.e.) Works</hi> or <hi>Duties</hi> flowing from my <hi>Calling, Station,</hi> in the world, <hi>Relation,</hi> or preſent <hi>condition,</hi> are not the <hi>work</hi> of my <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56286:9"/>
                  <p>Though here I grant it, that the <hi>work</hi> of a Saints <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> may fall in with the <hi>works</hi> forementioned, either thoſe which lye upon him as a <hi>Saint,</hi> or thoſe which are the proper <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>Calling, Station, Relation,</hi> or preſent <hi>condition, (i.e.)</hi> the <hi>work</hi> of a Saints <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and theſe, may be one and the ſame in Subſtance, though two in diverſe reſpects, as I ſhall make out to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For <hi>common Duties which lye upon a Saint, as a Saint.</hi> A <hi>Saint</hi> may have ſome duties lying upon him as he is ſuch a one, binding all <hi>Saints</hi> in all <hi>Ages,</hi> all the world over, which yet in ſome times may be the very <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example. <hi>Beleeving</hi> is a <hi>work</hi> which lyes upon a <hi>Saint</hi> as a <hi>Saint;</hi> A man as he is a <hi>Saint</hi> is alwayes, in whatſoever <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Generation</hi> he lives in, bound to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> and have confidence in the promiſe and power of God; but it may ſo fall out, that the diſpenſations of God towards his people may be ſuch, as that <hi>beleeving,</hi> which is an eſpecial <hi>duty</hi> lying upon <hi>Saints</hi> in all <hi>Generations,</hi> may be the great <hi>work</hi> God calls unto in that <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Generation</hi> a <hi>Saint</hi> lives in. So it was in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore (as I conceive) did God ſo ſeverely puniſh the <hi>unbeleef</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> becauſe this their fin was not only a neglect of a great and <hi>common duty,</hi> but a neglecting the very <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>duty,</hi> which lyes upon a <hi>Saint</hi> as a <hi>Saint,</hi> no <hi>praying</hi> man, no <hi>Saint;</hi> for <hi>Saints</hi> have their denomination from calling upon the Name of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. But now <hi>Prayer,</hi> a <hi>duty</hi> ſo general, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all <hi>Generations,</hi> may be, as the caſe may fall out, one ſpecial <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Generation</hi> a <hi>Saint</hi> lives in. And ſo (I take it) it was in <hi>Daniels</hi> time, when <hi>Iſraels</hi> feturn from <hi>Babylon</hi> was approaching, and therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſo ſtirred up to <hi>pray,</hi> and his <hi>Prayer</hi> made ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56286:9"/>
                     <hi>well-pleaſing</hi> unto God, becauſe he did not the thing only as a common duty, but as the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, upon the ſame ground wee are now ſpeaking of, God doth (as I conceive) forbid <hi>Jeremy</hi> to pray for the people of that time, becauſe <hi>Prayer</hi> though as a common duty it remained, yet did it then ceaſe as any <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>A Saint may have ſome duty lying upon him by vertue of his Calling, which may alſo be the very work of his Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example; Suppoſe a godly man be conſtituted a <hi>General,</hi> or an <hi>

                  <p>Again, put caſe a man is a Miniſter, the making known the truths of God to others is the work of his <hi>Calling,</hi> in doing whereof he doth no more then what his <hi>Calling</hi> requires of him, but now as ſuch a one ſtudies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crives, making it his deſign, ſcope and aim, not only to ſpeak truths (which another man by being conſcientious in his <hi>Calling</hi> may do) but to ſpeak truths, and truths in ſuch a manner, as is moſt ſuitable unto, and may through the bleſſing of God moſt conduce to the good and benefit of ſouls in thoſe times and places he lives in, ſo he doth the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as a <hi>Souldier</hi> in the field may do the work of his

                  </p>
                  <p>As to exerciſe <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> under ſufferings for Chriſt, is the work of a ſuffering <hi>condition;</hi> but now if my ſufferings fall out in ſuch an <hi>age</hi> wherein the Church of God in general lies under perſecution, then the exerciſe of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> under the Croſs, is not onely the <hi>work</hi> of my <hi>condition,</hi> but the very work of my <hi>Generation,</hi> that which the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of God in the <hi>age</hi> I live in, cals for at my hands.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, we ſee that ſuch a caſe may be that in the ſubſtance of the work, <hi>that work which lies upon a Saint as a Saint, and which is the work of his calling, ſtation, relation, and condition, may be the ſame with the work of his Generation;</hi> and yet in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects there may be ſuch a vaſt difference, that one man doing the ſame work, ſhall do more then that which lies upon him, and every one elſe as <hi>Saints,</hi> or which his <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſtation, relation,</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> calls for, and another in doing the very ſame <hi>work,</hi> ſhall do all this as well and better than he, and the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſpoken as touching this, the final concluſion is, <hi>that the work of our generation is not any work diſtinct in ſubſtance from all other works</hi> (for were it ſout would be a thing more eaſie to find it out than indeed it is) <hi>but the difference lies in conſidering the ſame work in divers reſpects,</hi> 'tis not diverſity of <hi>work,</hi> ſo much as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>reſpect</hi> in <hi>working</hi> that makes the difference.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next thing to be opened is, <hi>That the Saints in their ſeveral Generations, have had, and ſtill have their proper and peculiar works.</hi> My meaning is, That there is ſome <hi>work,</hi> which is more properly the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> living in one <hi>generation,</hi> than it is of <hi>Saints</hi> living in another. <hi>Saints</hi> of this <hi>Generation</hi> have ſome <hi>works</hi> which <hi>Saints</hi> of former <hi>Generations</hi> had not; and <hi>Saints</hi> of former <hi>Generations</hi> had ſome works, which <hi>Saints</hi> of this <hi>Generation</hi> have not.</p>

                  <p>For the making out of this, I ſhall draw a <hi>line</hi> through the ſeverall <hi>Generations</hi> that <hi>Saints</hi> from the beginning have lived in, and take a view of <hi>Saints,</hi> and of their <hi>work</hi> or <hi>works,</hi> each of them in their ſeveral <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Noah</hi> (for I cannot point out all <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> downwards, but ſuch onely upon which ſome remarkable actions of eminent Saints dwelling in thoſe <hi>Generations</hi> are fixed, thereby making them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable to after times) he beſides all his other <hi>works</hi> had the proper <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation,</hi> which was to build an <hi>Ark for the preſervation of his houſe, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the flood and univerſal deluge;</hi> by which he preached a real Sermon for one hundred and twenty years to the Old World, all the while the <hi>Arke</hi> was a preparing, and by which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>He condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the world, (i.e.)</hi> the perſons of that <hi>Generation,</hi> and this <hi>work</hi> it was a work diſtinct from the work of all other <hi>Generations.</hi>

                  <p>Next to him <hi>Abraham</hi> had the proper work of his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> which was, <hi>to go forth of his Country, and from his Fathers houſe, unto a Land which God ſhould ſhew him, and there to follow God from one place to another, beleeving that one day his ſeed ſhould en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After him <hi>Moſe</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and other <hi>faithful</hi> ones in their dayes, had the proper <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> which was <hi>to look up to God, and truſt him for meat, and drink, and rayment, and preſervation in a barren wilderneſs where none of theſe things were to be had, and where they lay open to cruel enemies on every ſide, to the

                  <p>Come to <hi>Davids</hi> time, he alſo had the proper <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation,</hi> wherein (as our Text witneſſeth) <hi>he ſerved God,</hi> which was <hi>to cut down Gods enemies round about, and thereby to make room and proviſion for the houſe of God, which was to be built at</hi> Jeruſalem, here was his diſtinctive work.</p>
                  <p>Next after him comes <hi>Solomon,</hi> whoſe diſtinct <hi>work</hi> was, <hi>to build the Temple of God, which his Father</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>had made room and proviſion for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To paſs over the <hi>works</hi> of many following <hi>Generations,</hi> let us come to <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> time, had not Gods people in that age the proper <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Genenation?</hi> which was <hi>willingly to put their necks under, and quietly ſubmit unto the yoke of the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up unto captivity until ſeventy years ſhould be accompliſhed.</hi> God did not give any ſuch poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands unto other <hi>Generations.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus all along in the times of the Old Teſtament, Gods Church and people in their ſeveral <hi>Generations</hi> have had their ſeveral <hi>works.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>After him the Apoſtles in their time had the proper <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation;</hi> which was, <q>to go forth and publiſh the glad tydings of ſalvation, which before were cooped up within the narrow compaſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> to all the world, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to gather Saints together, ſo faſt as they were converted, into Churches, and to appoint over theſe Paſtors and Teachers, and alſo to give Rules and Directions for the right ordering and governing of the Churches unto the end of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us come to the <hi>Saints</hi> of following <hi>Generations,</hi> had not they likewiſe their proper <hi>works?</hi> which was in ſome <q>to bear witneſs before the wicked world, and the Heathen Tyrants and Infidels of thoſe ages wherein they lived, to the truth of that Doctrine they had received from the Apoſtles before them, by ſealing the ſame with their blood, and willingly giving themſelves up (as ſheep to the ſlaughter) to the cruelties, tortures, maſſacres of the Paganiſh world, in bearing teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards the work of the next <hi>Generation,</hi> was <hi>to bear witneſs by writing, preaching, and all ſound Doctrine, againſt the damnable Hereſies of</hi> Arrius <hi>and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, and others, which through that little tranquility which the Church injoyed under</hi> Conſtantine <hi>crept in, and overſpread the Chriſtian world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In after <hi>ages</hi> for ſome hundreds of years together, the work of Saints in their <hi>Generation</hi> was <hi>to bear witneſs by ſpeaking and ſuffering unto the truth and worſhip of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, againſt the pernicious errors, and falſe worſhip of Antichriſt, and the boundleſs and ſwelling pride, and pomp of that man of ſin.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Generations</hi> ſince, the work hath been <hi>to recover the truth and worſhip of Chriſt, which was well nigh buried under Antichriſts reign, to its ancient purity, luſtre, and beauty;</hi> And ſo <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Saints and Worthies of his <hi>Generation,</hi> as their principal work, did recover out of the jaws of the Beaſt, the precious truths of Chriſts <hi>Prieſtly Office,</hi> the glorious Doctrine of our <hi>juſtification by Chriſt alone,</hi> which was well nigh ſwallowed up by the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian innovations of Maſſes, Croſſes, Pardons, Pennance, Purgatory, Vowes, Pilgrimages, ſolitary and ſingle life, with other inventions of humane wiſdom, for the procuring a righteouſneſs of our own.</p>
                  <p>And ſince him the great work of Saints in their <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> hath been <hi>to recover the Kingly Office of Chriſt, which the Lordly pomp and tyranny of the man of ſin and his followers had caſt a miſt upon, to ſet up Chriſt as ſole King and Governor in his Churches, as well as the onely and alone High Prieſt of his Saints.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Generation-work is of all others the greateſt work, and a neglect herein the greateſt ſin.</hi> My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that that <hi>obligation</hi> wherein I ſtand bound unto the <hi>work</hi> of my <hi>Generation,</hi> is a greater <hi>obligation,</hi> than that whereby I ſtand bound to any other <hi>duty;</hi> and my fault or error herein is a greater and more provoking error, than any other of my errors; which Aſſertion although it may ſeem ſtrange, yet it appears thus, in that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth more delight in, and account of that <hi>duty</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which is the <hi>work</hi> of our <hi>Generation,</hi> than he doth of the performance of any other <hi>duty,</hi> although it be a thing eſpecially commanded by himſelf; and on the other ſide, God is more diſpleaſed with, and provoked
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56286:14"/>by thoſe errors that men commit in the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> than with any other of their errors whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is evident in thoſe words of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offering, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams.</hi> The offering <hi>ſacrifice</hi> was Gods command, and a principal part of his worſhip in thoſe dayes, yet when <hi>Saul</hi> out of pretence of obeying this <hi>command</hi> of God, diſobeyed God in that other ſpecial <hi>command</hi> of utterly deſtroying <hi>Amalek,</hi> which was the great <hi>work</hi> God had to do, and <hi>Saul</hi> was imployed in, in that <hi>Generation;</hi> the Prophet from the mouth of the Lord doth not only reprehend him, and condemn his fact, but pronounceth theſe two things upon this occaſion now compared together, that God did more abundantly delight in, and account of the obeying of his voyce in that <hi>work</hi> which was the work of <hi>Sauls Generation,</hi> than either he did, or would do in Burnt-offerings, Sacrifices, or the fat of Rams, though things of his own appointment: In a word, the meaning is this, that obedience to God in that thing which is the <hi>work</hi> of our <hi>Generation,</hi> is more acceptable to God than the performance of the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial acts of his worſhip, as Sacrifice and Burnt-offerings in thoſe dayes were.</p>
                  <p>Hence we find in Scripture (which ſerves further to evidence this) that when ſpecial Ordinances or acts of worſhip have come in competition with the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> Ordinances and acts of worſhip, have yeelded and given place to that. Circumciſion was a ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance given to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, with that ſeverity that the uncircumciſed was to be cut off from amongſt his people; yet forty years together, whilſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> walked in the wilderneſs, the <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>Generation</hi> being ſuch as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56286:14"/>could not with ſafety to their perſons admit of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which required ſome fixed abode, at leaſt for ſome time (as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.8.) which they were ever uncertain of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow the motion of the cloud (as <hi>Num.</hi> 9.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) Circumciſion though Gods Ordinance (rather then God will alter the way of his <hi>diſpenſations,</hi> which he could eaſily have done) for forty years together (till <hi>Iſrael</hi> was entred <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo from under that <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of the cloud) muſt, and doth yeeld and give place unto the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation.</hi>

                     </gap> yet more, not only ſpecial Ordinances, but alſo common <hi>duties</hi> have given place to the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation.</hi> To keep inviolate Articles and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peace when made, though with a <hi>Turk,</hi> is a <hi>duty</hi> which the rule of common equity and juſtice betwixt man and man requires. Yet <hi>Jael</hi> when the <hi>work</hi> of her <hi>generation</hi> called for all the help ſhe could lend it (though a league were betwixt <hi>Jabin</hi> King of <hi>Hazor,</hi> and her Husband, yet) in the time of peace (which peace too (as far as we can underſtand) betwixt her Husband, and this <hi>King,</hi> was kept inviolate, as on <hi>Jabins</hi> part) ſhe (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her advantage) murders <hi>Siſera</hi> the chief Captain of <hi>Jabin</hi> King of <hi>Hazor</hi> in his Tent, and is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blamed, as ſhe is <hi>commended</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt for it.</p>
                  <p>And as this firſt is clear, ſo the other (viz. <hi>That neglect of Generation-work is the greateſt ſin</hi>) is as evident, not only from the foregoing words of God to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. paralelling his diſobedience herein with ſins of the higheſt, and of a ſcarlet dye; as Rebellion, Witch-craft, and Idolatry; but alſo if we conſider, how that of all the ſins we read of in Scripture, we find not any more provoking to the Lord, and falling ſo heavy upon the head of the ſinner, as offences and neglects in the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation.</hi> The Spies who were ſent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56286:15"/>by <hi>Moſes</hi> to view the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> they preſently dye of the plague before the Lord.

And which is very obſervable, they, befides this, were guilty of many other grievous ſins, being <hi>Idolaters, Fornicators, Luſters, &amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>beginning,</hi> and yet for none of theſe is the <hi>ſentence</hi> paſſed upon them, but only for their miſcarriage in that which was the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> Heb 3.19. <hi>They could not enter in becauſe of their unbeleef.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea wherefore was the <hi>unbeleef</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours and the Apoſtles time, puniſhed ſo ſeverely with a breaking off, and a rejection for now 1600 years together, but becauſe therein they ſinned againſt the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> which was to beleeve in Chriſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him as the Meſſiah, who they had long expected, and God in this <hi>age</hi> had ſent amongſt them? their crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt was a grievous ſin; but becauſe not a ſin againſt the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> therefore they are not for that act rejected, but contrariwiſe, after this the Goſpel is by ſpecial command to be preached to them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. but for not beleeving in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56286:15"/>him for the true Meſſiah, which was the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> they are rejected (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20—<hi>becauſe of unbeleef they are broken off</hi>) and ſo remain unto this day.</p>
                  <p>To all which let me further add, that not in theſe only, but many examples more, it ſeems to be Gods uſual way in the execution of his wrath againſt ſinners, to write the ſentence of their condemnation upon the forehead of this ſin, rather than any other. <hi>Saul</hi> ſinned in offering ſacrifice, and was then threatned with the loſs of the Kingdome, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13, 14. But the execution of this threatning, and the unkinging of him comes in upon his miſcarriage in that of <hi>Amalek,</hi> a ſin againſt the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Aaron</hi> ſinned moſt foul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God uſually writing the ſentence of his diſpleaſure upon the forehead of the moſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſin.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſpoken my Aſſertion ſtands firm, viz. <hi>That the obligation whereby I ſtand bound unto the work of my Generation, is a greater obligation than that whereby I ſtand bound to any other duty, and my fault or error herein is a greater error than any other of my errors.</hi> From which principle (before I leave it) I ſhal draw another, which naturally flows out of it, <hi>viz. That it is the duty of a Chriſtian man, imployed in Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work, when other works, and this do ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, to chooſe neglect in any duty, rather than in that, wherein the work of his Generation lyes, yeat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56286:16"/>the truth thereof it need not bluſh, carrying its evidence with its ſelf, yet in receiving of it, uſe Chriſtian wiſdom, and much more in the practice.</p>
                  <p>And here as a Concluſion to all the reſt, let me take the boldneſs for to add, what hath been ſometimes the iſſue of retired thoughts, that for this reaſon hath God ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and eminently owned, beyond belief, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, the never to be forgotten proceedings of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe (though they have ſeemed, at leaſt been charged by ſlanderous Tongues and Pens, with violating the bonds of relation) they yet have in all preſſed on, and followed after (though through a cloud of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid difficulties and dangers) the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 In doing <hi>the work of our Generation, we are moſt ſerviceable to the deſign of God, that is on foot in the age we live in.</hi> As there never yet was an <hi>age</hi> in the world, wherein God was not driving on, one great <hi>deſign</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (although the manifeſtation of his moſt glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and works of wonder, have ever been limited to ſome particular <hi>Generations;</hi>) ſo hath God in all <hi>ages</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf exceedingly well pleaſed with ſuch of his children, whoſe obedience hath more directly fallen in with his deſign on foot in their <hi>age. Daniel</hi> whilſt he is praying and mourning, hath the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſent unto him with this redoubled teſtimony from Heaven concerning him, that he was <hi>a man greatly beloved,</hi> Chap. 9.21, 22, 23. Chap. 10.11, 19. <hi>Iſay, Jeremy,</hi> and other godly men prayed, yet do not we read of any ſuch teſtimony given concerning them praying, as here is concerning <hi>Daniel,</hi> Why ſo? the reaſon may be this, <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer fell in with Gods <hi>deſign;</hi> God was upon a great <hi>deſign,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> this <hi>Daniel</hi> prays for, Gods deſign, and <hi>Daniels</hi> obedience meet together, and therefore doth God ſet a ſpecial ſtamp upon <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer.</p>

                  <p>Now in doing the <hi>work</hi> of our <hi>Generation,</hi> we are more ſerviceable to Gods <hi>deſign,</hi> than we can be any other way; for there being onely a reſpective difference betwixt theſe two (the ſame work which reſpecting God, is his <hi>deſign,</hi> reſpecting us, is the work of our <hi>Generation. Iſraels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Babylon</hi> was in reſpect of Gods <hi>deſign;</hi> but in reſpect of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the praying for this, was the work of his <hi>Generation</hi>) we cannot be active in the one, but in ſo doing we become ſerviceable to the other; as <hi>Daniel</hi> by prayer became inſtrumentally ſerviceable to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> delivery. Which by plentiful ordinary inſtance might be illuſtrated; but enough having been ſaid for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Reader in theſe few words, I ſhall not multiply.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 God will <hi>overlook many failings in that man.

                  <p n="2">2 God will <hi>ſtand by that man and never leave him,</hi> that ſticks cloſe to him in the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation.

(which circumſtance of time is therefore (I take it) with ſuch exactneſs noted, to give us to underſtand, that <hi>David</hi> ought now to have been abroad in perſon, the <hi>work</hi> being Gods, and not to have ſent his Servants without him (though we may do our own <hi>work</hi> by a Proxie, yet Gods <hi>work</hi> calls for our perſons) how ſadly doth he loſe his <hi>commumon with God,</hi> falling into that foul ſin in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>

                  <p>Once more here let us review that of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom God was pleaſed for ſome time to imploy, as a ſcourge to the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and yet afterwards by one error committed in the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Generation,</hi> he is for

                  <p>But more ſtrange and worthy obſervation is that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> two eminent inſtruments, and both godly, which God made ſingular uſe of in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at the Red Sea, in the Wilderneſs, and upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo appearing to them, talking with them, eſpecially to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as never man befides him enjoyed the like, yet theſe two ſo choiſe and worthy inſtruments, becauſe they failed a little in the <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>Generation,</hi> which was (as before was ſhewn) <hi>to beleeve in God, and truſt his power and goodneſs,</hi> although their failing was at ſuch a time (which one would judge might render them excuſable, at leaſt leſs guilty) wherein the whole Congregation erred with them, and (as it were) did hurry them into it; yea and for <hi>Moſes,</hi> he never fayled but this time, ſo that (this once excepted) he all along had <hi>followed God fully.</hi> Yet I ſay becauſe they failed God in that <hi>work,</hi> which was the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation;</hi> they for that, and no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are laid by as to the perfecting of that <hi>work</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi>) which moſt happily and proſperoufly was begun and carried on a great way, under them as inſtruments, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, becauſe ye believe me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, therfore ye ſhall not bring this Congregation into the land which I have given them.</hi> So exceedingly diſpleaſing to God are errors in the <hi>work</hi> of our <hi>generation,</hi> that he will not let ſuch things paſs, no not in his deareſt children, without ſome ſignal manifeſtation of his <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> And which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not let paſs without a further mark yet ſet upon it, as a thing moſt worthy the ſerious thoughts of every one, and ſuch in eſpecial, whom God above others, hath uſed and honoured in the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> is, how that one ſingle failing in the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> may cauſe a <hi>Moſes</hi> to be laid aſide.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Danger of <hi>ſtumbling at the work of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the diſpenſations of God about it.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſts time neglected the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>Generation,</hi> which was to <hi>beleeve in Chriſt, &amp; receive him as the true Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe coming their Nation was in expectation of, and the very <hi>work</hi> it ſelf (through this neglect) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone</hi> to them; they <hi>ſtumble at it,</hi> to think they ſhould receive this man for their Meſſiah, and <hi>ſtumbling</hi> at the <hi>work,</hi> they likewiſe <hi>ſtumble</hi> at the ſeveral <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of God about it.

                  <p n="5">5 Danger of <hi>being blinded in, or ſhut out of the work of the next Generation, in caſe thou live to ſee it.</hi> For God in his juſt judgement when men have ſhut their eyes againſt, and withdrawn their hands from the <hi>work</hi> of the preſent <hi>Generation,</hi> doth blind theſe perſons to, and will not honor them in the <hi>work</hi> of the following <hi>Generation</hi> though yet they may live to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>The Scribes and Phariſees wilfully ſhut their eyes to the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Johns Generation,</hi> and what followed? they ſee afterwards the <hi>work</hi> of Chriſt in his <hi>Generation,</hi> and of the Apoſtles in theirs, and through the juſt judgement of God upon them, their eyes are <hi>ſhut,</hi> and they are <hi>blinded</hi> thereto.</p>
                  <p>A moſt pregnant place to our purpoſe we have, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. verſ. 9. to 17. where under legal phraſes, and alluſive termes, the Holy Ghoſt ſetting forth Goſpel-worſhip, ſpeaks very pathetically of two ſorts of Prieſts, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Goſpel-ſtate. One were ſuch as had defiled
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56286:20"/>themſelves with the pollutions of the former <hi>Generation,</hi> by going aſtray to Idols when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went aſtray, verſ. 10, 12. who by way of puniſhment are to bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which is not wholly to be turned out of the <hi>work</hi> of God, who will ſtill uſe them in the general, and more common acts of his worſhip, as verſ. 11, 14. but to be ſet by as to the more ſpecial and peculiar acts of his worſhip in the <hi>Generation,</hi> becauſe they polluted themſelves with the Idolatries, and Superſtitions of the former <hi>Generations,</hi> as verſ. 12, 13. Another ſort of Prieſts there were, who when <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their fellow-labourers went aſtray, and defiled themſelves by Idolatry, did notwithſtanding walk cloſely with God, keeping their Garments pure from the defilements of that <hi>Generation,</hi> theſe are privileged to draw neer to God in the more ſpecial acts of his worſhip, to come into his Sanctuary, and perform the ſervice (not of the outward Court only, but) of his Table, as verſ. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>The difference betwixt theſe is worthy yet a more <hi>narrow</hi> ſearch. The one have the charge of the gates of the houſe, verſ. 11. the other Gods charge in his houſe, verſ. 16. the one ſhall only kill the burnt offering and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the people, verſ. 11. the other ſhall ſtand before God to offer the fat, and the blood, verſ. 15. The one ſhall ſtand before the people to miniſter to them, verſ. 11. the other ſhall come neer to Gods Table to miniſter to him, verſ. 16. The one ſhall bear all this as their ſhame for their former abominations, verſ. 13. the other ſhall receive all this honor as a reward for their not partaking in the abominations of the former <hi>age,</hi> verſ. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all is clearly this, That ſuch perſons who have plaid looſe with God in the former <hi>Generation,</hi> though live they may to ſee the next <hi>Generation,</hi> and be imployed in ſome common <hi>works;</hi> yet will not God uſe them in the ſpecial <hi>works</hi> of that <hi>Generation,</hi> except ſuch

                  <p>Having thus by this general light paved out a way to walk in. My next <hi>work</hi> is to ſee what particular light, by applying theſe things unto the preſent <hi>age,</hi> may from hence be gained unto the work thereof.</p>
                  <p>And here according unto the method before preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, our firſt inquiry muſt be after the <hi>age</hi> it ſelf. <hi>What age is that moſt likely to be, that we are fallen into?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to which, my Aſſertion is, <hi>that it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that we are fallen into that very age in which the Jews are to be converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although here I muſt nakedly acknowledge, that I could heartily wiſh, for their ſakes, whoſe this little Book is, yet clearer and more unqueſtionable grounds for the proof of this my Aſſertion, than thoſe that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion commonly ſtands upon: Yet in regard I know no clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer principle to demonſtrate (for bare conjectures are no proofs) the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> from, then this taken for granted, <hi>that we are fallen into that age in which the Jews ſhall be converted;</hi> and alſo in regard it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for a truth (and ſo in caſe of miſtake I ſhall not be the firſt) by many late Chriſtian Writers of worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, yea, with much confidence aſſerted by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, though under another notion, than what we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56286:22"/>truely call it of converſion to Chriſt, as <hi>Manaſſeth Ben. Iſrael,</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>The hope of Iſrael,</hi> Sect. 29, 32, 35, 36. is proof; I ſhall therefore endeavor to give you (with as much clearneſs and brevity as I may) the ſubſtance of that light, which by the labors of godly judicious men, [as <hi>Brightman, Archer</hi>] hath been let into that Scripture, which is the main bottom to this opinion, leaving the Reader to judge, and a little time to manifeſt the verity or falſity of what is written, the which we have <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. compared with 11, 12. where <hi>Daniel</hi> hath a promiſe made to him of his peoples <hi>deliverance,</hi> and that at a certain time when <hi>Michael</hi> ſhould ſtand up, <hi>at that time ſhall thy people be delivered;</hi> (which words (as I conceive) comprehend both the beginning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of their deliverance, to which, two diſtinct times are aſſigned, as afterwards.) Now becauſe this thing was a great <hi>ſecret,</hi> and <hi>Daniels</hi> affection to Gods glory, and the good of his own people, tranſported him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the particular time, he therefore moves the Queſtion, <hi>When ſhall this be? How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe wonders? v.</hi> 6. Anſwer hereto is made ſo darkly, that <hi>Daniel</hi> hears, but underſtands not; n&amp; therfore although in words far different, yet (as by the following anſwer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) aiming ſtill at the ſame thing, he puts the Queſtion again: <hi>What ſhall be the end of theſe things?</hi> Anſwer then is made, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>And from the time that the daily ſacrifice ſhall be tak n away, and the abomination that maketh deſolate be ſet up, there ſhall be a thouſand two hundred and ninety daies. Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thouſand three hundred five and thirty days.</hi> The meaning whereof ſeems to be this, that the beginning of the <hi>delivery</hi> of <hi>Daniels</hi> people (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>) ſhould fall out <hi>a thouſand three hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſo many years, a day for a year being the Scripture account, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6.) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56286:23"/>the taking away of the daily ſacrifice, and the ſetting up the abomination that maketh deſolate, and forty five years after that</hi> (for ſo many days hath the ſecond number more than the firſt) <hi>that the great trouble, which the Scripture not onely here, but elſewhere plentifully reveals</hi> (as <hi>Ezek</hi> 37.38, 39. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1, 2.) <hi>will attend that people in their beginning to ſeek the Lord, and</hi> David <hi>their King, ſhall they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from by the ſtanding of</hi> Michael <hi>their Prince,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Which becauſe till that day their deliverance (though began before) ſhall not be compleated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the bleſſing annexed not to the firſt, but to the latter time. <hi>Bleſſed is he that waiteth and cometh to the</hi> 1335 <hi>days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great knot here is (for the untying of which more light would be welcome) <hi>When the taking away of the daily ſacrifice, and the ſetting up the abomination that maketh deſolate</hi> (which is to be the head of our account) <hi>had its accompliſhment,</hi> and here the variety of mens judgements hath brought forth various conjectures, which not in this place to ſcan, I ſhall pitch on that which ſeems to carry greateſt probability of truth with it, which is the opinion of thoſe that bring it down to <hi>Julians time,</hi> fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon (as the mark they begin their account at) that particular act of his of endeavoring (by ſetting the <hi>Jews</hi> thereabouts) the re-edifying the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo thereby in malice and oppoſition to Chriſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Worſhip, to reſtore <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, at which time a fearful Earth-quake in the night did overturn all they had built in the day, yea, threw the very foundation ſtones of the Temple out of their places, which before had never been removed.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons why a fixation here is rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, than any where elſe, are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe if we make any other act ſince Chriſt before
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56286:23"/>this, the Head of our account, <hi>the time is already expired,</hi> and yet the <hi>Jews</hi> not delivered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe, <hi>No act whatſoever could more patly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the words themſelves, than this of</hi> Julians, <hi>which was an abomination of the higheſt to endeaver the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the Jewiſh worſhip, when God had thrown it down, and that out of a deſign to throw down Chriſtian worſhip, which God had ſet up:</hi> and ſuch an abomination as brought a deſolation, and an utter removal of the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice, the <hi>Temple-ground,</hi> the only place of ſacrifice, being at this time loſt. For although the daily ſacrifice did ceaſe before from <hi>Titus</hi> time, by whom the Temple was ruined, as it alſo did all the time that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whilſt the firſt Temple lay waſte, yet properly could it not either then or now, nor no more now than then, be ſaid to be taken away, becauſe the <hi>Temple-ground,</hi> to which (as the onely holy place) the Jewiſh worſhip was tyed, whereon a <hi>new Temple</hi> might be built, was ſtill remaining. But at this time, not onely the foundation ſtones being thrown up, but the very <hi>Temple-ground</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt in the Earthquake, it is not improper to ſay, <hi>the daily ſacrifice was taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 This likewiſe ſeems beſt to agree to the words of Chriſt himſelf, concerning the deſtruction of the Temple, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.2. <hi>There ſhall not be left one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down.</hi> For although the Temple was demoliſhed by <hi>Titus,</hi> yet the foundation ſtones did ſtill lie one upon the other; but now this act of <hi>Julians</hi> brought ſuch a deſolation, that as the building was ruined formerly, ſo the very foundation now had <hi>not a ſtone left upon a ſtone,</hi> which punctually agrees to Chriſts own words.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable that Chriſt himſelf makes this <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the abomination of deſolation,</hi> foretold by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> the immediate fore runner hereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. compared
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56286:24"/>with 15. which according to what hath been ſaid, was both immediate fore-runner and cauſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now for the preciſe time of this Helliſh exploit, there are among Hiſtorians four (how many more I know not) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts of the particular year in which the ſame was acted, though all I have hitherto ſeen or heard of, conclude it to be within the year of our Lord, 360. or 367. yet whether or no through ſome miſtake of Chronology, the difference may not be ſomewhat wider, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, though judge it very unlikely that it can or ſhould be much.</p>
                  <p>Accounting therefore (that we may draw to a head) from the year 366. (and the rather, becauſe the very year <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt number of days, will from thence fall in with, is already made famous by general expectations of ſome remarkable thing to be done therein) and the beginning of the <hi>Jews delivery,</hi> is likely to be, either in the year it ſelf, or thereabouts of our Lord, 1656. for adding 366. (the ſuppoſed year of Chriſt, wherein <hi>Julian</hi> did this) to <hi>Daniels,</hi> 1290. and there is made up the full ſum (neither over nor under) of 1656. which if when that time ſhall come we ſee accompliſhed, we need not then make it a queſtion, whether forty five years after their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhall be compleated, or not, <hi>Daniel</hi> having foretold, that in his laſt number of 1335. which he that ſhall take but ten from the 300 and add the ſame to the 35. will find that made up 45. and the foregoing number of 1290. to remain.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this reckoning is but of latter times, it is not therefore to be rejected, but rather to be received; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf tells us, that the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was to be ſealed up till the time of the end, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.9. which is alſo a manifeſt argument, that this cannot relate (unleſs in a typical way) to the times and ſtory of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as ſome godly and learned men would carry it.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56286:24"/>
                  <p>If any by calling in doubt the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever ſuch a thing as the Jews converſion ſhall be;</hi> queſtion the whole. My anſwer to ſuch is, That could I with that clearneſs demonſtrate the time of it, as (through the Lords aſſiſtance) it is eaſie to do, the thing it ſelf (were this the place for the doing thereof) I ſhould have ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to have injured truth, had I dropped doubtful words concerning the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe this Anſwer is none at all, and I would not have any take bare words for Arguments, and yet am loath here, neither is it proper to ſtart the queſtion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſetting aſide the joynt and concurrent teſtimony of every of the Prophets of the Old Teſtament (<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> onely excepted, which is rather a Hiſtory than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie) in this thing, the truth whereof is not much more difficult to prove, than to affirm: I ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend to ſuch, that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. who ſpeaks expreſly not of <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> but of <hi>natural Jews,</hi> whom therefore he all along oppoſeth to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> calling them alſo <hi>branches broken off,</hi> which cannot be <hi>ſpiritual</hi> branches but <hi>natural,</hi> v. 21. &amp; the ſame <hi>broken off,</hi> ſhall be <hi>grafted in again,</hi> v. 24. And this not done only one by one in continuance of time, but (according to that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.8.) in a manner all at once, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. And ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved— which as yet we have never ſeen, and yet becauſe Scripture ſpeaks it, are to believe it.</p>
                  <p>Thus according to preſent light (both of what I have received from others, and have been able to add of my own) a diſcovery of the <hi>age we live in</hi> hath been made, and found to be that in which the great <hi>work of Iſraels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> is moſt likely to be effected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Our next thing is (that we may walk in the path before laid down) to obſerve what <hi>thoſe glorious and remarkable things are, the accompliſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God hath foretold and promiſed in and about theſe times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56286:25"/>
                  <p>And here give me leave to ſay, that when I take a view of what holy Scripture hath recorded, of that time in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall return to their own Land, and alſo to the Lord, and <hi>David</hi> their King, that I do find this <hi>age</hi> (none more) <hi>full of wonders;</hi> to all which, Gods glorious <hi>work</hi> of <hi>redeeming Sion,</hi> literal <hi>Sion,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> from their long <hi>captivity;</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Sion,</hi> or the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> bondage (as it were) the Axis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they turn.</p>
                  <p>Now to enumerate each particular of thoſe tranſactions that Scripture tells us ſhall fall out in this <hi>age,</hi> is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but onely to take notice of ſome of the chief, (and ſuch as are moſt free from exception) for the directing of us to that which is our ſpecial <hi>work</hi> in this <hi>Generation.</hi> Which are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Iſraels Redemption;</hi> Which although by menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning here again, I may ſeem to tautologize, yet muſt I do it, this being the firſt and great thing promiſed, which therefore we have before proved, and make uſe of as a mark to deſcry the reſt by.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Onely here I would carry this along with me, that in regard as yet things are but coming on, therefore many things before this <hi>Generation</hi> is over, may be tranſacted, which yet we ſee little of.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 As for the <hi>uniting of Saints that differ,</hi> although here with grief we muſt confeſs the <hi>breach</hi> is yet too wide, yet with joy and comfort we may alſo truly ſay, it is not ſo wide as lately it was, many cloſing, and loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in moſt parts of the Nation, who five, nay two years ago could not do it: and if ſo little time have made ſuch a bleſſed beginning, what may we expect from more?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 And as for <hi>the pulling down of high and lofty things,</hi> if our <hi>age</hi> bear not witneſs of this, it doth of nothing; for doth not the whole world ring again with the noyſe that hath been made through the late fall of <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coral</hi> powers in <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 For the <hi>eſtabliſhment of Juſtice and righteouſneſs,</hi> tho we want in reſpect of what we would have, yet all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced perſons muſt nakedly confeſs a good foundation

                  <p n="6">6 And for the <hi>powring out of the Spirit,</hi> though it ought to be our grief wee have ſo little of it, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Gods people in this <hi>age,</hi> without great ingratitude to the Father of mercies, but acknowledge that he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo been more bountiful unto them, than unto others of his dear Children, and their fellow-ſervants in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>age;</hi> thought theſe then with that little they had, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more obedient to their Father, than we now: and as we have ground for hope, ſo is it our duty to beleeve for yet more.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 And as for <hi>increaſe of light</hi> (without tranſgreſſing the rules of modeſty, or exalting our ſelves in this preſent <hi>age,</hi> in teſtification of our thankfulneſs to him from whom our light is) we may truly, and humbly ſay, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>age</hi> hath brought forth ſome truths, eſpecially thoſe which concern Chriſts Kingdom, which till now have not with that clearneſs been revealed in any ſince the Apoſtles times.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 And laſtly, For the <hi>exaltation of Chriſt as King,</hi> when ever was there a time (ſince the Apoſtles) that could ſhew half ſo many Churches as at this day are to be ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere? yea, when ſince the beginning was Chriſt ever in ſo fair a way to be King over the world? and when ſo much worldly power in the hands of godly men as at this day?</p>
                  <p>So that in <hi>Gods diſpenſations</hi> to this <hi>age,</hi> we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begin to read thoſe very things he hath <hi>foretold</hi> ſhall be in that <hi>age</hi> in which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be <hi>converted,</hi> which (as hath been before proved) is this <hi>age</hi> wee live in.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56286:29"/>
                  <p>And the more is this to be conſidered, becauſe <hi>diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> being that which giveth call to the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> it is enough (ſuppoſing we had no other proof) in caſe we behold preſent <hi>diſpenſations,</hi> pointing to ſuch and ſuch things, to know there lyes the <hi>work</hi> of this <hi>age:</hi> Yet in regard light burdens no man, and the lovers of truth are never offended with truth for its clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore this Rule (which alone gives ſo much light into the <hi>work,</hi> as that it will be (as hath been before clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) ſin in that man, who wilfully ſhutting his eyes to the ſame, neglects the <hi>work</hi>) is here brought in, hand in hand with others, of no leſs evidence and demonſtration than it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Our fourth Rule formerly laid down, is to <hi>obſerve what work that is which is moſt raged againſt by the Devil and wicked men,</hi> for ordinarily there (as was then proved) doth lye the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation.</hi> Now here conſider what are thoſe things the Devil rageth againſt, and the World would fain hinder in this <hi>age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To omit the firſt, becauſe the <hi>work</hi> not appearing as yet (though we hope God is making a way thereto) the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth not as yet appear openly (in this <hi>age</hi> more than formerly) for to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the ſame. But to come to the next.</p>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>Converſion of Sinners</hi> one thing raged againſt? witneſs the many obſtructions in the way of propagating the Goſpel; The oppoſition to the Doctrine of glad tydings to Sinners therein revealed, and alſo to godly men becauſe Mechanicks, whom God in many places with happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is pleaſed in this day to make uſe of, for declaring of them.</p>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>prevention of union among Saints</hi> another? by fomenting diviſions through Jeſuitical practices, and thereby drawing them into parties, and then ſetting one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the other.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56286:29"/>
                  <p>And is not this another, the <hi>pulling down of high and lofty ones?</hi> doth not the world generally ſtorm to ſee Kings and Biſhops plucked from their ſeats? <hi>As one of their party ſaith, Had he had a hand in the pulling down of Regal or Epiſcopal Power, he ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to have committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who knows not the oppoſition that <hi>the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs meets with at this day in the world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea farther, is not the <hi>Spirit</hi> a thing mocked at, you have the <hi>Spirit;</hi> theſe are men of the <hi>Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> And the very term of <hi>new Light</hi> is not onely diſtaſteful but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, What ways have been of late years to prevent and root out, if poſſible, <hi>Chriſts Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Churches?</hi> and are at this day to obſtruct the ſame, which is hoped to be now riſing over the world, is apparent to all men.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that the very things Satan rageth againſt, are the ſame that the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of old have <hi>foretold,</hi> and the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of God call for in this age.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We have but one Rule of diſcovery more (prayer excepted, which is Cloſet-work) and that is, <hi>to obſerve what spiritual inlightned Saints have upon their hearts, as the work of their Generation.</hi> And although here I cannot enter into mens hearts, yet this I may ſay, ſo far as my own acquaintance leads me, I have ever obſerved the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the moſt ſpiritual enlightned Saints beating this way: And the publique deſires of many for things of this nature, ſhews how others ſtand inclined towards the doing of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus you may eaſily perceive whitherto all theſe Rules tend, each of which ſtanding upon firm ground, as hath been before declared.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56286:30"/>
                  <p>The concluſion then (putting all together) is this; <hi>That the work of the preſent Generation, which Saints are bound to attend unto, and to be active in,</hi> lies princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in theſe things. <hi>The converſion of the Jews, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, in order to a greater Harveſt of Gentiles, Joynting Saints (Chriſt myſtical body) into one. Pulling down of all high and lofty things, and perſons, that oppoſe Chriſt. The eſtabliſhment of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in the world, Striving with God in a more eſpecial manner for a greater degree of his Spirit, more light and grace than Saints in former Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have had; together with the exaltation of Chriſt as King, both in his Churches and alſo over the world.</hi> Which laſt, conſidering how that all the reſt are in a way of ſubſerviency thereunto, and do, as it were, centre therein, for therefore are <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> at this time to meet together, as Subjects under one Prince, that this <hi>Kingdom</hi> of his might be great, and full of Subjects; therefore ſhall <hi>diviſions</hi> amongſt his <hi>people</hi> ceaſe, that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> might be quiet and peaceable; therefore ſhall <hi>high and lofty ones be pulled down,</hi> that Chriſt might have no <hi>Competitor</hi> or <hi>Check mate</hi> (as I may ſay) in this his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> therefore ſhall <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> be eſtabliſhed, that ſo the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in this reſpect might ſurpaſs the <hi>glory</hi> of all <hi>Kingdoms</hi> before it; therefore ſhall there be more of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> more <hi>light</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> given forth to the Saints, that ſo they might yeeld <hi>obedience</hi> to their <hi>King,</hi> not ſo much from a <hi>Law without,</hi> as a principle of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>love within,</hi> I ſay all centering in this laſt, my utmoſt concluſion is, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-peece of <hi>work</hi> in this <hi>Generation</hi> is, <hi>the advancement of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 But <hi>how may I come to know or find out that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part, or parcel of work, which is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be my work in my Generation, and which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56286:30"/>me to be active in?</hi> ſeeing it cannot be ſuppoſed that any one man can be active in the whole <hi>work;</hi> neither undoubtedly is it required of him.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, I ſhall in general lay down this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contrary Propoſition, <hi>viz. That there is no part or piece of Generation-work, but every Chriſtian man or woman may in ſome way be helpful thereunto, ſo far as he is called to act, and conſequently becomes guilty of neglect of Generation-work in not acting,</hi> As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By <hi>prayer to God for the proſpering and carrying on of the work.</hi> Thoſe who can do nothing elſe, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>pray for the peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> Pſal. 122.6. yea all that make mention of the Lord in the day of Gods building Sion, are bound not to <hi>keep ſilence,</hi> nor give God <hi>reſt</hi> till he <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> and till he make <hi>Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth,</hi> Iſ. 62.6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>By humbling our ſelves before God for that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, whether found in the people of God, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments imployed in the work, or any other that proves obſtructive, and a hindrance to the work.</hi> When the ſin of <hi>Achan</hi> became an obſtruction to the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua's age, Joſhuah</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael rent their cloaths, fell to the earth on their faces, put duſt on their heads, humbling</hi> themſelves before God for it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                  <p>Now although acting in this manner (in caſe we can do nothing elſe) may ſeem little in our eyes, yet in the eyes of God, it doth not ſo, who takes it exceeding well at the hands of his people, when they can ſerve their <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> no other way, that they do in this.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſo provoked God, that God was upon the point of deſtroying of them, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>Moſes</hi> then falls down before God forty dayes, and forty nights, and by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting</hi> prevails with God, not only to ſpare them, but alſo by the manifeſtation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56286:31"/>of his preſence and glorious power ſtill to go along with them, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14, 15. And how pleaſing <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer to God in this buſineſs, was, appears, in that the glorious diſcovery of Gods back-parts to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and proclamation of his Name before him (ſuch a diſcovery as never <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf at any other time, nor any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him ever had) comes in as the <hi>fruit</hi> of this his <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding</hi> for the people, and in behalf of the cauſe of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. compared with Chap. 34.5, 6, 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> did many glorious <hi>works</hi> in his <hi>Generation,</hi> which others could not follow, yet God chooſeth to make his glory paſs before him, not in doing them, but that which every Saint may imitate him in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> in like manner, when as yet there was no viſible way for publick actings in that which now began to be the buſineſs of the <hi>Generation,</hi> makes it his private work to ſtrive with God by <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> for the ſame, as Chap. 9. and how well God did like hereof, you have heard before, and the ſucceſs of <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer (verſ. 20, 21, 22, 23.) is ſufficient teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>So alſo <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>Age</hi> lay out of his power to act any thing therein, ſave only in this way of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> he as the other (this being the common way of Gods people in ſuch caſes) betakes himſelf unto this <hi>work</hi> of <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> before God in reference to the ſame, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how wonderfully God was pleaſed herewith, the ſequel of the ſtory ſhews, for within four months after (his <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> being in the month <hi>Chiſleu,</hi> verſ. 1.) the ninth month according to the Jewiſh account, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.1. in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thereof in the month <hi>Niſan,</hi> Chap. 6.1. the firſt month after their account, as <hi>Eſter</hi> 3.7. and all in one year, (as by comparing Chap. 1.1. with Chap. 2.1. is evident) God in an extraordinary way doth ſo bring things about,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56286:31"/>that this <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> man for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſolations, is furniſhed with commiſſion and authority from the King to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there to re-edifie the City, and build up the wall thereof, the very <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In caſe therefore <hi>Generation-work</hi> lie at ſuch a plunge as thou canſt act no other way in it, or in caſe thou beeſt one who wanteſt both opportunity and imployment wherein thou mayeſt be helpful in any particular way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy <hi>Generation,</hi> then ſerve the ſame in this general way, which ſervice from the hands of ſuch a one is accepted of God, and the party doing the ſame, in Gods account, faithful in his <hi>Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe many there be, who beſides the general way of acting (which is a <hi>duty</hi> common to all) may in other more ſpecial wayes be ſerviceable to their <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who (yet neither their <hi>call,</hi> nor <hi>opportunity</hi> reaching to the whole <hi>work,</hi> but ſome part of it) will be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive how they ſhall know that <hi>particular part of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration-work, which is more properly theirs.</hi> To the end that ſuch may receive ſatisfaction in this thing, I ſhall deſire them to go along with me through theſe following Rules.</p>

So <hi>Wickleff</hi> and <hi>John Hus</hi> in their ages made diſcovery of ſome <hi>light; Luther</hi> in his <hi>Generation</hi> of more; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in his of more, in reſpect of ſome things wherein <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was in the dark; and the <hi>ages</hi> ſince of more, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome things wherein all the <hi>foregoing Worthies</hi> were in the dark. And this to ſay is no diſparagement to them, who did worthily in their <hi>Generations,</hi> nor mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>exaltation</hi> to our ſelves, who have nothing but free Grace to boaſt of, nor any other reaſon to give, why it ſhould thus be, but this onely, ſo it pleaſed him.</p>
                  <p>Yet as then when truth came forth in being, <hi>the new light of the Generation</hi> did oftentimes <hi>offend</hi> perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in thoſe <hi>Generations,</hi> ſo as they could not ſee the <hi>work,</hi> of the <hi>Cerations;</hi> as the perſecutions that many
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56286:37"/>of the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles of the New, did ſuffer from the men of thoſe <hi>Generations</hi> for the ſame, doth witneſs; So now when truth is coming forth in regard of diſcovery, the new diſcoveries of truth have been and are a continual <hi>offence</hi> to the men of theſe laſt <hi>Generations,</hi> even to the oppoſing the very <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> they have lived in; as the ſufferings of thoſe Witneſſes of Jeſus, who ſtood up for the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt about <hi>Luthers</hi> daies by the Papacy; and the perſecutions of thoſe <hi>Worthies</hi> ſince who have maintained the Kingly Office of Chriſt by the Prelacy, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nick-names of truth in this our <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>new light,</hi> the common by-word of the Country doth clearly and fully evidence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, At thoſe <hi>ſtumbling blocks which uſually are laid in the work of the Generation.</hi> It is a thing to be noted, that almoſt in every <hi>age</hi> God hath laid ſome eminent <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi> in the <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>age,</hi> both for the trial of the <hi>faith</hi> of his own people in getting over them, and for his Enemies to <hi>ſtumble</hi> and <hi>fall upon;</hi> which <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi> as they have exerciſed the <hi>faith</hi> of the one, ſo have they been continual Rocks of <hi>offence</hi> unto the other.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Noahs</hi> time, when the <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>age</hi> was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and prepare for a univerſal deluge, what a <hi>ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block</hi> (in reaſon may we think) was it to the Old World to hear of ſuch a thing one hundred and twenty years before it comes, to look for it year after year, one hundred and twenty years together, and yet no appearance of ſuch a thing; might they not well conclude before half that time was expired, that <hi>Noah's</hi> preaching was a fable, and his building the <hi>Ark</hi> a fancy, for no ſuch thing as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would ever be?</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent of God into <hi>Egypt</hi> to deliver Gods people thence, which was the <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>age</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56286:38"/>what a palpable <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> was it to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to behold the very ſame miracles which were wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to evidence his being ſent of God, done by their Magicians: might they not well ſay, is this man ſent of God? then are our Magicians, for they do the ſame things as he.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards in the wilderneſs did not this lie as an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> before that <hi>Generation?</hi> that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſhould there wander to and fro forty years, till the whole <hi>Generation</hi> of men that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, before they muſt enter that Land they were brought out to poſſeſs?</p>
                  <p>At the time of the building the ſecond Temple, upon <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which being in the latter times of the Jewiſh State, (was I take it) the Type of Chriſts building his Church in the laſt days, upon the coming out of Antichriſtian <hi>Babylon</hi>) what a <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> was it, that the great <hi>work</hi> of that time, the which they were come from <hi>Babylon</hi> about, ſhould receive ſuch a nip at the very beginning, as to be at a ſtand forty years together before it could go on? might not Gods people fear, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies conclude, this <hi>work</hi> would now ſurely come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? who will wonder that Temple-building hath been at a ſtand for many years, ſince the comming out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> myſtical, that conſiders thus it was upon the coming out of literal <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their Temple was the type of ours.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts coming into the world was accompanied with two notable <hi>ſtumbling-blocks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He was born of <hi>mean Parentage,</hi> when as he was looked for amongſt the Royal or Prieſtly ſeed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He firſt <hi>appears out of Galilee,</hi> and (by vulgar eſteem) is a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> whereas all knew the Meſſiah was to come out of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Theſe two ſo viſible <hi>rocks of offence,</hi> as they drew the generality to oppoſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56286:38"/>him, pleading againſt him, and for themſelves, <hi>Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee?</hi> Hath not the Scripture ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt commeth of the ſeed of David, and out of the Town of Bethlehem where David was?</hi> Joh. 7.41, 42. So were they ſore tryals to the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who not ſtrictly inquiring into Chriſts deſcent, and the place of his birth, but taking things upon truſt, from report of the vulgar (a weakneſs too incident to many true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſouls) made that their <hi>ſtumbling-block,</hi> which rightly underſtood, would have been a <hi>confirmation of their faith,</hi> as appears in that good plain-hearted <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> who was without guile, could not tell how a while to get over this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.46. <hi>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to ſay no more, When Chriſt ſent forth Apoſtles into the world about the great <hi>work</hi> of that <hi>Generation,</hi> did not this lye as a ſore <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> before many, to ſee the learned ones, the Doctors and Rabbies of the times ſet by, and in this glorious <hi>work,</hi> a company of poor illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fiſher-men imployed?</p>
                  <p>And as it is moſt evident, that in <hi>Generations</hi> formerly, God for wiſe ends hath ever laid <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi> in the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generations:</hi> So he that ſhall but narrowly obſerve Gods <hi>diſpenſations</hi> towards his people of late in theſe our times, ſhall find this verified, nothing more, there having hardly been any great Victory obtained, or any thing remarkable performed, which hath not had his <hi>ſtumbling</hi> going along with it, and happy is he, whoſoever is not <hi>offended</hi> thereby.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God in his ſecret providence, &amp; unſearchable wiſdom hath ſo thought it good, that <hi>Generation-work</hi> ſhould meet with its affronts, not only from the tumultuous confuſed rabble of

                  </p>
                  <p>It was a <hi>religious party,</hi> yea, and that too upon a <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground</hi> (as well as a <hi>politick</hi>) <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.49, 50, 51, 52. that gave wicked counfel for the putting of Chriſt to death.</p>
                  <p>It was a <hi>religious party,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>devoute wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that raiſed perſecution at <hi>Antioch</hi> againſt the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> expelling <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the faithful Preachers thereof out of their coaſts, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.50.

Now though there ſeemeth in it to be juſt matter of jealouſie, yet if ſeriouſly weighed and compared with foregoing Preſidents it is not ſo: for who knows not that <hi>Solomon</hi> was the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ever built a houſe for the true worſhip of God, and yet the firſt that ever built High places for Idolatry. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt Diſciple that publickly confeſſed Chriſt, and yet the firſt that openly denyed him. <hi>Judea</hi> was the firſt place where <hi>Goſpel-light</hi> did ſhine, and from whence the world was enlightned, and yet the firſt place where error ſprung up, and the light of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> darkned, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Certain men came down from</hi> Judea <hi>and taught the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, except yee be circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>yee cannot be ſaved.</hi>

                  <p>What need I multiply? let reaſon, not ſeeing Gods will, be judge of <hi>Jehues</hi> action, in putting the King his Maſter to death, and extirpating the Royal Family, and will it not brand the ſame with the odious names of Diſloyalty, Uſurpation, and Treachery to his Prince? which yet was an act commanded by God, God having ſo ordered it, that in all ages there ſhould ſtand in the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſome ſuch facing and ſtaring actions as ſhould not onely amuſe men, but alſo offend the eyes of the obſtinate, weak, or ignorant beholders.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Kingdom of Chriſt in his Churches, it is a moſt <hi>glorious work,</hi> yet <hi>low in the beginning.</hi> The building of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56286:40"/>the ſecond Temple, which (as hath been ſaid) was the type of this, had firſt a <hi>day of ſmal things, which lookers on were ready to deſpiſe.</hi> Zach. 4.10. <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmal things?</hi> before a day of great things.

The planting of Churches in the Primitive times, what a <hi>low beginning</hi> had it; one <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few poor Fiſher-men acting in this <hi>work,</hi> and that againſt all the world.</p>
                  <p>This is lively ſet forth in that Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.31. <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of muſtard-ſeed</hi>— It begins as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, and of this but one grain, not many; yet in the end it grows a <hi>Tree that the Fowls of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56286:41"/>ever to riſe, was it in the beginning? One <hi>David,</hi> a poor mans Son, a keeper of ſheep, to be a King, and yet his Kingdom at preſent in the hands of another, a powerful King <hi>Saul,</hi> one choſen and annoynted by God, to whom the whole Nation had ſubjected themſelves, and under whom they had obtained glorious Victories. Who would ever have thought this Kingdom could have riſen, and yet it did?</p>
                  <p>Chriſts riding into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as King (which, I take it, did ſhadow out both theſe) it was upon an Aſs, one of the moſt deſpicable of all the creatures; and yet, not upon a grown Aſs neither, an Aſs in his full ſtrength, but upon a Colt, the Foal of an Aſs, the weakeſt and moſt deſpicable, of the moſt deſpicable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.5.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is Gods way in great <hi>works</hi> (eſpecially in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration-work</hi>) to begin <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>riſe</hi> by ſteps.

                  <p>If the Commands of God himſelf, and the ſpecial acts of his worſhip are to give place (as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) to the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any want of that due reſpect, that is, and ought to be given to mans Law, it may be ſaid, and alſo without offence, that humane Laws are much more to ſtoop, and fall down to it; the Authority of God being above that of man.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Eſters</hi> time there was a Law in the Kingdome of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and the foundation of it was no other but the priviledge and honour of the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56286:46"/>that whoſoever, man or woman, ſhould come in unto the King in the inner Court, except ſuch to whom the King ſhould hold out the golden Scepter, he ſhould be put to death, Chap. 4.11. Which Law in it ſelf was not evill, as it was meerly Politick, reſpecting only the Honour, State, and Priviledge of the King: Yet when the Cauſe and People of God lay at ſuch a plunge, that without intrenching upon this Law, Gods Cauſe in that <hi>Age</hi> muſt have fell to the ground; <hi>Eſther,</hi> though uncalled by the King, yea more, having no other Command from God (as formerly hath been ſhewed) but only the viſible <hi>Call</hi> of a <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> puſheth upon the Pikes of the Law, and runs the hazard of the perill of death, and how wonderfully God did ſtand by her, and preſerve her in ſo doing, the iſſue of this her dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempt recorded in the Hiſtory may ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported of the Primitive Saints, that theſe words, the <hi>KINGDOM OF CHRIST,</hi> the <hi>KINGDOM OF CHRIST,</hi> were ſo <hi>frequent</hi> in their mouths, that their malicious Adverſaries (willing to miſtake the ſimplicity of their meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) did make the words matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> charging them hereupon with <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as if they had driven on ſome deſign to get for themſelves the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Whether the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Saints in the <hi>age</hi> we <hi>live in,</hi> who being come to the very <hi>dawning</hi> of the day, and beholding the Lord <hi>going up</hi> to his Kingdom, cannot hold their peace, but muſt cry out <hi>HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID, HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST,</hi> may through the <hi>ſubtlety</hi> of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent have any ſuch <hi>abuſe</hi> put upon it, or no, I wave at preſent. But this I am ſure of, the firſt ages had not the Kingdom of Chriſt ſo <hi>much</hi> in their mouths, but after ages had it as <hi>little;</hi> their hearts were not ſo warm to it, but the generations ſince have been as <hi>cold.</hi> And indeed
<pb facs="tcp:56286:49"/>it was <hi>neceſſary</hi> it ſhould ſo be; for the <hi>Beaſt</hi> Antichriſt being to riſe in the world, who after his riſe muſt continue to reign two and forty months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. it was needful therefore, to the end he might be <hi>revealed,</hi> that there ſhould be (as the Apoſtle tels us 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>a falling away,</hi> which falling away above all things was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that it ſhould be in the <hi>Truths of Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> no <hi>Truths</hi> being ſo diametrically <hi>oppoſite</hi> to <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as theſe; others ſhake off his <hi>leaves,</hi> theſe pluck him up by the <hi>roots.</hi> If therefore the policy of the Dragon had not found out a way to brand <hi>theſe Truths,</hi> and by making them odious, to hold them down, his Kingdom muſt have <hi>fallen</hi> many ages ſince, for he ſhould have had no Beaſt to reſign his Power, Seat, and great Authority to. It ſtood him greatly in hand therefore by ſome means to cloud theſe, which by continuing to ſhine, would have nipped Antichriſt in the bud; and this the wiſdom of God permitting, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh thereby in the end a more glorious deſign, which he effectually did.</p>
                  <p>Hence within the <hi>fourth Century</hi> (at the end of which the Beaſt aroſe) the <hi>Truths</hi> of Chriſts Kingdom (before generally received) began to be <hi>condemned,</hi> and to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the odious name of <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we <hi>finde</hi> not in the <hi>Revelations</hi> any <hi>mention</hi> made of Chriſts Kingdom, nor any noyſe of ſuch a thing in the world all the time of the Beaſts reign; but the great cry of the dwellers on the Earth is, <hi>The Beaſt, the Beaſt, who is like unto the Beaſt? yea the whole world wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth after the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>But now in the <hi>latter</hi> days, as the <hi>Beaſt</hi> begins to go <hi>down,</hi> ſo do the precious <hi>Truths</hi> of Chriſts Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain begin to <hi>revive,</hi> and have a <hi>reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence we finde that as the <hi>world</hi> by degrees gets <hi>rid</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſo is the cry in it ſtill louder and louder of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56286:49"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Amongſt the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> who no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have got ſo much footing as to <hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>face</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which before trod them down, and trampled upon them, but <hi>preſently</hi> they make the <hi>world ring</hi> again, with the <hi>noiſe of Chriſts Kingdom.</hi> Rev. 15.2, 3, 4. <hi>And I ſaw them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Image, and over his Mark, and over the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Name, ſtand on the Sea of glaſs having the Harps of God, And they ſing the Song of</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſervant of the Lord, and the Song of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, juſt and true are thy ways thou King of Saints; Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy name, for thou onely art holy? for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgements are made manifeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, After this the <hi>Beaſt</hi> having received a more <hi>fatal blow,</hi> the <hi>cry</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among <hi>ſome Saints</hi> onely, is now more <hi>general,</hi> and runs among the <hi>multitudes,</hi> yea, the <hi>great ones</hi> too (of whom till this day we hear little) as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6. <hi>And I heard as it were the voyce of a great multitude, and as the voyce of many waters, and as the voyce of mighty Thunderings, ſaying, Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Yet after this, upon the <hi>ſounding</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh Angel</hi> (when Chriſt comes to take his Kingdom) it is then <hi>openly proclaimed</hi> with a <hi>great voyce,</hi> Rev. 11.15. <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Thus the <hi>noyſe</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> towards the <hi>latter</hi> end of Antichriſts reign, is very <hi>different</hi> to that which was in the <hi>time</hi> of his reign, then the <hi>cry</hi> was, <hi>The Beaſt, The Beaſt:</hi> now the <hi>old cry</hi> is up again, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt, The Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> the <hi>cry</hi> of Chriſts Kingdom ſhall at this day be ſo <hi>loud,</hi> ſhall not the <hi>ears</hi> of all, no not of the <hi>Saints themſelves,</hi> be <hi>open</hi> to <hi>hear it;</hi> but <hi>ſome</hi> of them (as well as others) ſhall be ſo deeply wedded to the ſweetneſs of <hi>Antichriſtian wordly intereſts</hi> that (to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe) they ſhall rather chooſe to <hi>ſit by the waters of Babylon,</hi> than with the loſs of them to ſtand with <hi>the Lamb upon Mount Sion;</hi> elſe what <hi>need</hi> would there be of any ſuch <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, as we read, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before <hi>Romes ruin?</hi> Rev. 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her ſins, and that yee receive not of her plagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>theſe</hi> who <hi>thus ſhall do,</hi> are not to be <hi>reckoned</hi> among thoſe who in this great buſineſs <hi>followed not the Lamb at all,</hi> but among <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>followed the Lamb ſome part of the way</hi> towards Mount Sion, but upon ſome <hi>turn,</hi> or <hi>falling in</hi> with ſome worldly pleaſing intereſt, by the way did quit his company, before they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe the <hi>hundred forty and four thouſand,</hi> which ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. are <hi>differenced</hi> from others, not in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>they were Saints,</hi> and others <hi>not;</hi> nor in <hi>this,</hi> that they <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lamb,</hi> which others <hi>did not;</hi> but the <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is made to lye in theſe two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They were <hi>Virgin-Saints,</hi> which had not <hi>defiled themſelves with women, i.e.</hi> were not eſpouſed to any worldly intereſt, the deſire of which is as natural to the hearts of men, as the deſire of women; and particularly, they had never any thing to do with the intereſt of that
<pb facs="tcp:56286:50"/>Whoriſh woman, ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. And this to be the meaning of the phraſe the foregoing words do give it, which by a parallel phraſe, ſetting forth the ſame thing, cals them the <hi>Redeemed from the earth, i. e.</hi> from earthly intereſts, as outward glory, honor, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 They were ſuch who <hi>follow the Lamb whetherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes, Verſ.</hi> 4. If the Lamb will go in ſtrange untrodden paths, making his way over the necks of the Kings, and Princes of this world, they will follow him there. If in unpleaſing paths, turning about in a manner upon themſelves, and treading under feet their beloved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, dear, and near Relations, taking from them their outward glory and ornaments, yet they will make a turn with him, and follow him there: for they are ſuch as will <hi>follow the Lamb whetherſoever he goes.</hi> Now although there may be many beſides theſe at this day, who may come under the more general Character of <hi>Saint-ſhip,</hi> and <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lamb, i.e.</hi> for ſome time, yet ſhall they be found ſhort of theſe particular Characters, <hi>viz.</hi> of being <hi>Virgin-Saints, un-eſpouſed to worldly intereſts, and followers of the Lamb not onely here, and there, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence we have it ſpecially noted of theſe, that <hi>they ſing as it wert a new Song, before the Throne, which no man could learn, but onely the one hundred forty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand which were redeemed from the earth,</hi> verſ. 3. Why doth the Holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>As it were a new Song,</hi> and not rather a <hi>new Song?</hi> The reaſon I take to be this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Song</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> of it in <hi>general,</hi> is the <hi>old Song,</hi> i.e. the <hi>ſame Song ſtill,</hi> that all the children of <hi>Sion</hi> ſung together upon their firſt coming out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But now the <hi>Lamb</hi> their Leader, having upon his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> taken ſome ſtrange, rough, untroden, unexpected paths, which they upon their coming out did not ſo much as dream of, many of thoſe who upon his
<pb facs="tcp:56286:51"/>firſt march ſet forth with him, with as loud a cry as the reſt: begin now ſome to draw backwards again to <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſome to lag behind their Colours; and now <hi>they can ſing with the reſt no longer, i.e.</hi> they cannot now any longer own his Appearances and workings, praiſe him or magnifie his name for them; yet for all this, even at this time when many fall off offended, the <hi>One hundred forty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand redeemed from the Earth,</hi> they march on with the Lamb, <hi>ſinging ſtill,</hi> owning, approving his works, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep him company whetherſoever he goes. Now in this reſpect the Holy Ghoſt doth not term it <hi>a new Song,</hi> but <hi>as it were a new Song,</hi> becauſe it puzzles moſt of the <hi>old Singers,</hi> ſeeming akogether new, and another to them, though yet indeed it is the <hi>ſame,</hi> the <hi>change</hi> being more in them, than in the <hi>Song,</hi> and the <hi>One hundred forty four thouſand can ſing it ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence likewiſe this <hi>One hundred forty four thouſand</hi> are ſpoken of as being a <hi>ſelect</hi> and <hi>picked party</hi> called therefore, verſ. 4. <hi>The redeemed from among men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt fruits unto God, and to the Lamb, i. e.</hi> they are (if I may ſo ſay) for the choyceneſs of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits above others in adhering to the Lamb their Leader, the very cream of men, ſuch as the Lamb accounts his firſt fruits, <hi>i.e.</hi> makes more ſtore of than of others, who yet may bee of his Corn, and a part of his Harveſt too.</p>
                  <p>And as that which is not here impertinent, we may obſerve, that as the coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was in Old Teſtament times one eminent type of the <hi>Saints deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> from Spiritual <hi>Antichriſtian bondage,</hi> for which cauſe the <hi>Antichriſtian State</hi> is ſpiritually called <hi>Egypt,</hi> Revel. 11.8. and the <hi>comming</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, another; for which cauſe <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi> takes denomination from <hi>Babylon:</hi> So is it a thing worthy to be noted, as touching both theſe Types, that
<pb facs="tcp:56286:51"/>that <hi>Generation</hi> which by ſtirring ſet the <hi>work firſt on foot,</hi> did afterwards prove the <hi>greateſt</hi> (I may ſay the onely) <hi>retarders</hi> of it. For as touching the firſt, WHO <hi>hankered</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi> WHO though come out, yet had been brought up there: WHO <hi>moved</hi> the <hi>returning</hi> back again? but that <hi>Generation</hi> that came thence: WHO made light of the <hi>great things</hi> God did in the Wilderneſs? but that <hi>very Generation,</hi> who from the firſt had <hi>ſeen his mighty Wonders</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the <hi>Second,</hi> WHO are they that cry out, <hi>The time is not come, the time that the Lords houſe ſhould be built?</hi> Hag. 1.2. But that <hi>very Generation</hi> who came out of <hi>Babylon</hi> with great hearts at firſt to do the work; but were afterwards engaged in particular concernments, and private intereſts, <hi>building ſeiled houſes for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> verſ. 4. hereby letting the work of their <hi>Generation</hi> lie waſte.</p>
                  <p>And truly it is that which I have verily thought with my ſelf, and that ſome time, namely, <hi>That it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us in this Age, coming out of Antichriſtian Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, even as it did them coming out of Egypt and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon of old, i.e.</hi> we ſhould ſee thoſe <hi>very perſons</hi> who leading us out of <hi>Babylon</hi> at firſt, did cry, <hi>Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> either by hankering after the Egyptian Fleſh-pots of Honor, Profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which once having taſted they cannot loſe the relliſh of) <hi>wholly to quit their firſt principles and affections,</hi> and ſo ſet their faces back again to return into <hi>Egypt;</hi> or if not ſo, yet at leaſtwiſe (as the commers out of <hi>Babylon</hi> did, who were ſomewhat the better of the two) finding difficulty in going on, <hi>make a ſtand</hi> on the way, there <hi>building ſeiled houſes for themſelves, i.e.</hi> advancing their own particular intereſts inſtead of helping forward the work of Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56286:52"/>
                  <p>What ſhall I any further enlarge upon this uncouth Theam, harp any longer upon this unpleaſing ſtring? It was without doubt an ill <hi>Omen</hi> to <hi>Barnabas</hi> when he choſe <hi>Marke</hi> to go with him to the work, who had before deſerted it, that <hi>he ſhould do but little</hi> in it. And indeed the Event proved it; for as by that act he <hi>loſt the hearts of the Church,</hi> who recommended <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> to the Grace of God, but take no notice of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> and <hi>Mark;</hi> So alſo is it obſervable, that from <hi>that very day, he who was ſo active before, we hear no more of him.</hi> True, he had this to plead, <hi>Mark was a good man,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> whoſe eyes were more <hi>open,</hi> ſaw, that <hi>notwithſtanding his goodneſs,</hi> yet having once at <hi>a pinch</hi> deſerted Chriſts Cauſe, he was not a man likely afterwards to <hi>thrive with,</hi> in carrying it on; and therefore <hi>wife, wary Paul,</hi> if there be no other way to clear his hands of him, for the works ſake, rather than he will run the hazzard, he will bid farewell, even to his old beloved preaching, ſuffering Companion, <hi>Barnabas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now as for you (dearly Beloved) to whom I dedicate theſe Lines; I onely ſay, The Book it ſelf is yours, and whatſoever of the mind of Chriſt is diſcovered in it is yours. I ſhall therefore cloſe up this my Epiſtle with the words of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12, 13 &amp;c. <hi>For the day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low. And upon all the Cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Oakes of Baſhan. And upon all the high Mountains, and upon all the Hills that are lifted up. And upon every high Tower, and upon every fenced Wall. And upon all the ſhips of Tarſhiſh, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all pleaſant Pictures. And the loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the herghtineſs of men ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:56286:52"/>made low; and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. And the Idols he ſhall utterly aboliſh,</hi> Ezek. 17.24. <hi>Then all the Trees of the field ſhall know that it is the Lord that hath brought down the high Tree, and hath exalted the low Tree, hath dried up the green Tree, and made the drie Tree to flouriſh.</hi> Iſa. 9.3. <hi>The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not in my thoughts when I put forth my former peece, which I was moved to do, partly for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome, who had ventured far in the work of their Generation, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the provocation of others, that I ſhould have appeared again upon the publick Stage, whence few that climb up, come down any better than loſers, if not from men, yet through that corruption that lodgeth in their own hearts: But being by more than one or two, upon the coming forth thereof, deſired to ſpeak my thoughts more clearly and particularly as touching the <hi>Deſign</hi> or <hi>Deſigns of God in the Age we live in:</hi> And to that end, ſome propoſing this <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> as a ſubject moſt ſuitable for ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which opened, they conceived would further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the Werk of this Generation; and being added as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the other, might be of uſe: Although conſidering how great the Task was, how myſtical that <hi>Prophecy</hi> in particular, upon which the thoughts of good men were ſo various, and how unskilful I my ſelf was in the general knowledge of the Prophets, which was a thing moſt neceſſary to ſuch an undertaking, I did for a while lay aſide wholly the thoughts of ſatisfying their deſires; yet finding deſires renewed, after I had given them over, I knew not but that it might be ſome call unto me, ſeeing nothing but my own diſcouragements lying in the way to hinder: Whereupon I reſolved to
<pb facs="tcp:56286:53"/>make a trial, and as the Lord ſhould come in with light, ſo to proceed, or give over; being incouraged hereto from that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. <hi>12.4. That the Book was to be ſealed up but to the time of the end, when by the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too and fro of many</hi> (which implies a kind of duty) <hi>knowledge ſhall be increaſed;</hi> And alſo conſidering that a <hi>ſpecial bleſſing</hi> (ſurely to quicken our dull hearts to this Work) is annexed to the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> both at the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>ending,</hi> whereas no Book beſides it in Scripture hath the like, Chap. <hi>1.3. Bleſſed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep thoſe things which are written therein,</hi> Chap. <hi>22.7. Bleſſed is he that keepeth the ſayings of the Prophecy of this Book.</hi> Theſe things were at firſt ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, and are ſtill refreſhment to my spirit, as touching what I have done; for though I will not ſay, I have in all things found the truth, (which yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf is through Grace in ſome things here done) yet do I judge a liberty left for me, as well as others, to croud into the number of that many, <hi>who run too and fro</hi> to finde it; and alſo do beleeve it is a thing may be done without prejudice to a mans grace, comfort, or communion with God, yea, as a help to all theſe, ſeeing that a <hi>ſpecial bleſſing</hi> from Heaven is pronounced to ſuch as <hi>read, hear, and keep theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the Treatiſe it ſelf, I may give this account of it, That when I began, my thoughts were not upon a ſecond Part, but onely to have added this, as a brief <hi>Appendix</hi> to my firſt. But after I had taken a ſerious view of the Prophets and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> comparing one with the other. I ſaw ſo many precious ears of Corn lye ſcattered every where, that an eager deſire of gleaning, made me forget my firſt reſolutions, and this little Peece (which I had in my thoughts, laid out but for two
<pb facs="tcp:56286:54"/>or three ſheets at moſt) upon the ſudden to ſwell into a ſecond Part, more large than the former. And truly in doing of it, I have been ſo far from moulding things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any pre-conceived opinion (which I find a thing moſt apt to deceive) as that (ſetting aſide ſome general perſwaſions, which I had before as touching <hi>Chriſts coming</hi>) I have upon deliberate conſideration, ſeen real cauſe to forſake ſome things formerly taken up by me; and to alter thoſe general conceptions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had of the <hi>Vials,</hi> almoſt in every thing.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding I had ſome thoughts at firſt poſitively to lay down my own opinion in things referring to the <hi>Vials,</hi> without mentioning the opinion of others, yet did I afterwards judge it convenient for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſuch who delight to turn over Expoſitors, not only to lay down my own, but alſo briefly to inſert thoſe reaſons, which pondered in my thoughts, made me ſee a neceſſity to forſake the old beaten paths, and ſeek a new; wherein I can ſpeak it truly, I have not deſired to beſingular (though oft neceſſitated ſo to be) nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken any man, ſo far as by right reaſon I have been able in my moſt ſerious thoughts, to bring his opinion, and the truth together; and where I could not, though I highly reverence the men, as ineſtimable of more worth for grace and abilities both, then a hundred ſuch as my ſelf, yet have I not durſt to follow them, becauſe I have taken it up as my reſolution in this day (which through the grace of God aſsiſting, I ſhall hold unto) not to follow any man, or men living, though I honor their holineſs, and love their parts, any farther then I can ſee the truth, and them to follow that, nor for any reſpect whatſoever to forſake any man, ſo far as he appears to me to go with that; And in this reſolution (as to the preſent work) I am confirmed, by conſidering that the knowledge of thoſe Prophecies which relate to the laſt
<pb facs="tcp:56286:54"/>times, is to be attained, not ſo much by ſettling upon old received Principles, as by <hi>running to and fro</hi> to ſeek new Light and further Diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>If any inquire of me as touching the reaſons, why I have forborn to mention the names of ſuch Authors, as I have had occaſion in this Diſcourſe to deal with; my anſwer is, becauſe I would not appear as an oppoſer of men, though for the love of truth I am an oppoſer of falſe Principles, which may be in the beſt man; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe I would not give juſt cauſe, by bringing the names of good men upon the ſtage, to any who yet are living, or the friends or lovers of ſuch as are deceaſed to be offended. I might adde another reaſon (with wiſhes it were otherwiſe) becauſe many Profeſſors in our dayes, are grown ſo wanten, that the very naming a good man, and ſhewing him to be in a miſtake, is enough to make his name of little eſteem, if not odious with ſome of them. And yet although I have ſuppreſſed names, have I alwayes laid the weight of their Reaſons in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; not willingly concealing, nor extenuating by my laying it down, the ſtrength of any one Argument, that whilst I was compoſing this Diſcourſe, I could meet with making againſt me; which for any to do, I have alwayes judged a manifeſt ſign of one, who rather ſeeks to make others think him a Victor, than to finde the truth.</p>
                  <p>Having given thee (Chriſtian Reader) this brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the riſe of this enterpriſe, and my progreſs in it, I have only two or three things to adde.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In caſe thou art one who art a young beginner, whoſe face is but newly ſet towards Truth, to ſeek it, let me commend to thee this one rule amongſt many (which thoſe who wait for the Spirit ſhall learn) it being that which the Author (being ſuch a one as thy ſelf) finding himſelf wearied, and quite tired out in ſeeking
<pb facs="tcp:56286:55"/>after truth, whilſt he hath addicted himſelf to follow now the opinion of this man, now of that; being able all this while to ſettle upon nothing, hath in the end been forced (as in other things, ſo in this) to have recourſe unto; which is, to take the naked Scripture, and read it over, and by ſome diſtinguiſhing mark made in the Bible to ſever thoſe Scriptures, which in the Prophets and elſewhere treat of the laſt times, from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whoſe ſubjects are different; which done, thou ſhalt then be able, by the help of thy mark to turn thy Bible over, and in a few hours to conſider all that from one end of the Scripture to another, hath ſpecial relation to the laſt times (or by making a different mark to any ſubject into which thou deſireſt light) whence having firſt by comparing the whole together founded thy ſelf upon ſuch Principles as are contradictory to no part, thou ſhalt then be able to paſs a right judgement upon the different minds and ſayings of Writers, knowing when and where to chuſe and refuſe, as they agree with, or differ from the ſubſtance of that truth which in Scripture hath ſpecial relation, either to ſuch a Time, or ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and as where this is carefully and underſtandingly done, there will be little need of the multitude of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; ſo where it is omitted, there will be little elſe ſave confuſion to him that ſhall turn them over. And this let me ſay further, in doing of it, thou mayeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thy ſelf (through the help of the good Spirit) more full ſat is faction then I will promiſe thee, from what I have written, or from any Book extant that ever I met with beſides the Bible, and willingly I would have been here at the pains to have pointed out to thee thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whoſe ſubject is the laſt times, but that I judge that to read over thy Bible diligently thy ſelf, and mark them out, will do thee much more good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In caſe thou art one whoſe delight and
<pb facs="tcp:56286:55"/>ſtudy runs this way, to pry into the myſteries of the laſt times, if he might teach, who indeed hath more need to learn, I would ſay, make ſtops ſometimes, and look round about thee, leſt while thou art running on, ſuppoſing thou ſeeſt thy way before thee, thou doſt unawares out run thy Leader, which if thou doſt, thou wilt ſtreightway be woodded, and wildred, and go to work with thy reaſon only, (which will never make good work) to hew the way thou ſhouldſt go in; And further, never fear to make a turn out of the common road (though ſtanders by cry, you are out of the way) if ſo be thou perceiveſt truth to have taken that path before thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If thou art one who art offended at the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſpenſations of this age, and upon that account no friend to ſtudies of this nature, I only ſay, perhaps thy readineſs, to be offended at what is done, and doing at this day in the world, ariſeth hence from <hi>a not obſerving the ſigns of the times;</hi> ſtudy therefore theſe things a little; and more, take a wiſe mans counſel, Act. <hi>5.36. Refrain from cenſuring and oppoſing, for if the work now doing in the world be of men, it will aſſuredly come to nought; but if of God, happily whilſt ye oppoſe, ye ſhall be found to fight againſt God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, Whatſoever thou art, receive not what is written without triall, nor throw it away (upon a looſe triall) with a Tuſh; the one is an enemy to thy comfort, for he that ſwallows meat whole, taſtes not the ſweetneſs of it; the other may be to thy light, for he that's reſolved to open his eyes but half way, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee men like trees. And as things are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a ſpirit of infallibility, ſo as that all muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; ſo neither (I hope) is any thing put in with ſo much levity as deſerves to be caſt out with a Tuſh; but rather lay Scriptures together, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh things well, and then judge; Thus the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, and are called
<pb facs="tcp:56286:56"/>noble for ſo doing; whereas thoſe who take things upon meer truſt, and thoſe who throw them away without any triall, are neither of them noble.</p>
                  <p>Only in caſe of trial, do not for one ſingle Scripture, which may ſeem to thee to contradict any part, reject the whole, but rather lay Scripture to Scripture, till the whole of Scriptures is brought to ſome harmony, by which time poſſibly thou mayeſt ſee reaſon to be of my mind; if not, a better harmony being found, I ſhall (I ſo hope at leaſt) with thanks for light, willingly relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh my own, and come to thine.</p>
                  <p>And further, In caſe ſome things upon diligent fearch do evidently appear to be miſtakes, do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe of ſome weeds, throw away all the corn; he that will eat no corn, but what grew up without weeds muſt eat none at all; he that thinks to have truth from ſuch imperfect creatures as we are, without error, erres himſelf whilſt he ſo thinks.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, In caſe thou ſeeing reaſon for it, doſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive things, receive them not as bare notions, which will be little benefit to thee, or comfort to me, that I have laboured only to fill mens heads; but now and then ſuck upon them in thy Meditations, perhaps thou mayeſt find ſome ſweetneſs in them, they have not been all dry bones to the Author in compoſing; who there fore in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure hath ſtudied plaineneſs and brevity (ſo far as will ſtand with weak capacities) that things might be fitted the more (without being tireſome or tedious) for thy meditations.</p>
                  <p>Let none wonder I have written out ſo many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at large, they were ſent to me in writing, I thought they might be ſo to thee in reading, and it hath been ſometimes a queſtion with me, whether a defect in this, and a bare quotation of Chapter and Verſe, hath not made the Writings of ſome more dry to the
<pb facs="tcp:56286:56"/>Reader, then otherwiſe they would have been?</p>
                  <p>I have no more (Chriſtian Reader) ſave to beg thy prayers for me, in doing which, let me obtain thus much; That in caſe the Lord make any thing either in this, or my former part uſeful to thee, and affecting to thy heart, that in the midſt of thy joyes, thou wouldeſt not forget to ſend a groan or two to Heaven in the behalf of the poor unworthy Author (who would not, had he not much need thereof, ſo publickly make this requeſt, and having need, is glad he can do it) that the Lord would make, and keep him very humble, that the improvement of a talent of gifts, may not at all be prejudicial unto grace; Withall, that he may not at laſt, having preſſed others to the work of their Generation, be himſelf found negligent, and as an unprofit able inſtrument be laid by therein, which he can never look down into his own heart, but he ſeeth real cauſe to fear, from which yet he hopeth (Saints helping together with prayers for him) he ſhall be kept, who is,</p>

                  <p>This is clear Chap. 15.2, 5. where as <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the powring forth of the <hi>Vials,</hi> we have,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Victory gotten over the Beaſt, and over his Image—</hi> verſ. 2, which is not in ſuch a ſenſe to be underſtood, as though the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> his <hi>Image, Mark,</hi> ſhould hereby be aboliſhed or deſtroyed: For then what need would there be of any <hi>Vials</hi> to be poured forth upon the Beaſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the work being done, and he deſtroyed already; or why ſhould his <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> be mentioned again in the firſt <hi>Vial?</hi> But the meaning is (as I conceive) that Saints immediately before the Vials begin to be poured forth, ſhall ſo far have gotten the victory over the Beaſt, as concerns either the ſafety of their own perſons, or the doing of the work; yet Antichriſt ſhall not have power over them to make them ſubject themſelves to him, allow of his Image, Mark, the number of his Name; or elſe to perſecute them, kill them with the ſword, as in former times he hath done; nor ſhall he have ſuch a power as to hinder them in the work they are going about, of powring out the Vials.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in Heaven is opened,</hi> verſ. 5.

                     <hi>That the Vials are to be poured forth by Angels onely coming out of the Temple, cloathed in pure and white linnen, having their breaſts girded with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den girdles,</hi> Ver. 6.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56286:58"/>
                  <p>The meaning is, That the Inſtruments God will imploy in doing of the work (at leaſtwiſe for the ſwaying and ruling party amongſt them) ſhall be ſuch as have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the falſe Idolatrous worſhip of Antichriſt, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo far as their light goes, the true worſhip of Chriſt, in which reſpect they are ſaid to come <hi>out of the Temple;</hi> whoſe converſations ſhall be pure and unſpotted, therefore cloathed in <hi>pure and white linnen,</hi> and their deſigns and actings for God in managing this great buſineſs (how ever judged or ſcandalized by others) ſhall yet be carried on with much ſincerity, uprightneſs, and integrity, which as a <hi>golden Girdle</hi> ſhall be upon their <hi>Breaſt.</hi>

                  <p>Hence not the <hi>Turk,</hi> nor the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor any of the Antichriſtian Princes or party, nor any other who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Idolaters, falſe Worſhippers without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, can be looked upon, or interpreted, to be the <hi>Angels</hi> of any of the <hi>Vials.</hi>

                     <hi>That Gods call to the Angels of the Vials to pour out their Vials, is to be principally looked for out of the Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>matter of</hi> their work is to be looked for in the <hi>word,</hi> that what they do be agreeable to that Rule; but the <hi>Call</hi> to go about the work, that is, without delay to <hi>pour out this,</hi> or that <hi>Vial,</hi> is mainly to be looked for <hi>out of the Temple.</hi> Chap. 16.1. <hi>I heard a great voyce out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, Go your ways; and pour out the Vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</hi> The meaning of the word, is not as if by one general command from the Temple, all the Angels were authorized at once to pour out their <hi>Vials;</hi> no, but as the Angels were diſtinct, ſo they had diſtinct <hi>calls;</hi> yet the <hi>Call</hi> of each came as a <hi>great voyce;</hi> that is, with much power out of the <hi>Temple;</hi> God firſt ſetting it ſtrongly upon the hearts of his people in his <hi>Temple,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56286:59"/>that ſuch a work is to be done (<hi>I Jeſus have ſent my Angel to teſtifie theſe things in the Churches, Chap.</hi> 22 16.) who thereupon with a <hi>great voyce</hi> cry mightily to each Angel (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch inſtruments as they ſee God hath raiſed up, and impowred) to do that work.</p>
                  <p>Yet underſtand this, I am now ſpeaking not ſo much of the <hi>general Call,</hi> as a more <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Call,</hi> peculiar to this time of the Vials. The general <hi>Call</hi> to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration-Work</hi> is (as hath been proved in my firſt part) <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> but now at this time, beſides the Call of Gods <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,</hi> the inſtruments God ſhall raiſe up to ruin the Whore, ſhall have a more <hi>particular Call</hi> to this work, to the end they may neither flag nor draw back, namely the <hi>loud and unceſſant cry of the Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Hence</hi> the general voyce or cry of Gods people out of the Temple, is much to be heeded in that age, in which the <hi>Vials</hi> are pouring forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence</hi> ſecondly, Extraordinary actings, or actings in a ſtrange and extraordinary way, are to be looked for, whilſt the <hi>Vials</hi> are pouring forth; for is it not a wonderful and an extraordinary thing to attempt things new, and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages unheard of, and that upon this account chiefly, that it is the general voyce, and cry of Saints, that they have it upon their hearts, this work muſt be done.</p>

                  <p>Hence, not Chriſt himſelf, not the Scriptures, not the Church or people of Chriſt, nor any ſuch like thing, nor the inanimate creatures, as the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Elements,</hi> may be accounted the ſubject of any of the Vials,</p>

                  <p>My meaning is, the immediate following Vial, or the Vial following that may ſometimes be poured out before the Effects of the foregoing Vial are wholly ceaſed; For although an order is ſo to be obſerved (the Holy Ghoſt having laid it down) as that we muſt not conceive all are to be poured out at once; yet it is unbecoming the Majeſty of God, to tye him up ſo ſtrictly to order, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>punctum</hi> of time ending one Vial, to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next.

                  <p>For if we take the <hi>Earth, Sea, Rivers, and Fountains</hi> of waters, <hi>Sun, Air, &amp;c.</hi> in a litteral ſenſe, how ſhould a Vial of wrath poured out on theſe, be any whit more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial (without a miracle) to Gods enemies, than his friends, who partake of the benefit of theſe in common with the other?

                        <p>Of the whole Univerſe, <hi>Earth</hi> is the moſt groſs part; <hi>Air</hi> is of a ſubtle nature; <hi>Water</hi> of a more groſs; Earth the groſſeſt of all, as being the dregs and ſettlements of the whole. By <hi>Earth</hi> then, we are not here to underſtand, <hi>Earth</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Heaven,</hi> i.e. the true Church, as verſ. 1. but the <hi>Popiſh Earth,</hi> viz. the groſſer part of Popery, or the Lees and Dregs of that Religion, oppoſed to the finer parts of it.

                        <p>Upon theſe filthy <hi>Dregs of Romiſh Doctrine,</hi> began the firſt Vial to be <hi>poured forth</hi> by <hi>Luther,</hi> and other Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of thoſe times, who by the light of truth made ſuch a diſcovery of the unſoundneſs, yea, perniciouſneſs thereof, as that now the ſame began to be odious in the eies of all.

                        <p>The generality of the people who before adored them as Gods, not once calling their principles or practices into queſtion, did now by the pouring forth of this Vial, come ſo palpably to diſcern the groſs and horrible Idolatry of theſe their Forgeries, as that they began to <hi>loath</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,</hi> not only the things themſelves, but the very <hi>Aſſertors of them,</hi> and to <hi>withdraw</hi> from them as infectious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, full of <hi>grievous and noyſome Sores;</hi> ſo that now they can no longer delude the people, and draw them to a loving and liking of theſe things, as formerly they had done; no, but themſelves with their principles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention are become odious, and a filthy ſtinking Sore in the eyes and noſtrils of the Commonalty. <hi>Which Effect,</hi> how evidently it did ſhew it ſelf in <hi>Germany,</hi> and here with us in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo in other Nations, about this time, upon the preaching and writing of the forenamed Worthies, with others their fellow-helpers, is by many ſufficiently recorded.</p>

                        <p>And that which will not weaken this Interpretation in caſe it be conſidered, is, that as the two great things of Jeſus Chriſt that Antichriſt had invaded, were his Prieſtly office, and Kingly; The firſt by his pernicious <hi>Doctrine;</hi> The ſecond by his abſolute tyrannical <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> So the firſt remarkable blow that Antichriſt ever ſuffered, was in detecting and deſtroying his curſed <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and groſs Idolatries by it maintained, with which he had made an invaſion upon the mediation and <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of Chriſt;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56286:63"/>which being done, becauſe yet Chriſts <hi>Kingly</hi> office was invaded by an Antichriſtian Lording <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> Chriſt therefore (that he might fully recover his own, before he invades his enemy) makes it his next attempt to regain into his own hands his <hi>Kingly</hi> Power and Authority, which to do, the very next remarkable blow that befalls the Man of Sin (after the hot controverſies about Chriſts Mediatorſhip, and our juſtification by Chriſt alone began to ceaſe, the Saints in this having obtained a compleat victory, and given their Adverſaries both the rout and ruine) is in his Lordly Tyrannical <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> which ſtraitwayes now begins to be queſtioned; yea not onely queſtioned, but finally is ſhaken, yea thrown down as Antichriſtian, and that by Law.</p>
                        <p>If it be ſaid, That <hi>Arch-biſhops, Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are but an inferior and an inconſiderable part of the Romiſh Hierarchy, and therefore the downfal of theſe, ſeems to have too much put upon it, whilſt the ſame is made a principal Effect of that Vial, which is poured out upon the Hierarchy it ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To that I <hi>anſwer,</hi> though inconſiderable and inferior, yet are they a part of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> whoſe ſtanding is by the ſame power, and upon the ſame bottome with the reſt: And had it not been for a Vial of wrath poured upon the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> it ſelf, theſe as <hi>parts</hi> of it could not have fallen: Neither is it neceſſary that the pouring out of the Vial, ſhould ſweep away the <hi>whole</hi> at once, for that were to deſtroy Antichriſt with <hi>one</hi> Vial, and not with <hi>Seven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be further <hi>objected,</hi> that <hi>this hath been done but in our Iſle of Great Britain, the Hierarchy even at this day in moſt of the Kingdoms ſubjected to the Beaſt being in as full and abſolute power as ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My anſwer is, That ſo long as the Iſle of <hi>Brittain</hi> is reckoned amongſt the Horns of the Beaſt, it is ſufficient,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56286:63"/>though but in one Horn this be done; for neither did the former Vial extend it ſelf to all the parts of the Papal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (for the greater part lye rolling in the very Lees and Dregs of Popery unto this day) nor indeed ſhall any of the Vials, the laſt excepted, be poured out upon the Kingdome of the Beaſt in general, but ſome fall upon one part of it, ſome another.</p>

                        <p>And alſo ſecondly, becauſe though they have been cauſers and promoters of ſhedding the blood of Saints, yet the act of blood-ſhedding hath ever been by another power, to whom being condemned, they were turned over to be executed; and as the blood of Chriſt, though cauſed by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> is yet ſaid to be ſhed by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> becauſe by his power the thing was acted; So the continual blood-ſhed of Saints in the Kingdome of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> though cauſed by the Biſhops, may yet be ſaid to have been done by the Civil power, becauſe by that power the thing hath been acted.</p>
                        <p>That by <hi>Rivers and Fountains of waters,</hi> the Jeſuits ſhould be here meant (as a late godly Writer judgeth) ſeems not probable to me; 1 Becauſe they are no where in all this Book ſet forth by any ſuch name. 2 Becauſe had this Vial been poured out, and that (as is judged) ſome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56286:64"/>yeers paſt upon theſe, moſt ſurely this generation of men had not been ſo riſe and active, and that in all places, as at this day they are. 3 The Jeſuits (ſetting aſide what they have done in a ſecret way by Treachery, and that of ſome few only) have not been actors any whit more in <hi>ſhedding the blood of the Saints,</hi> than their Fellow-companions the Biſhops and Doctors of the Romiſh Synagogue. 4 And laſtly, The time aſſigned for the doing of this, was many yeers before the ſecond Vial was poured forth, and therefore a thing moſt unlikely that this ſhould be the meaning.</p>
                        <p>A late worthy Writer upon the Vials, in this (as in many things elſe) varies from the common-road of Expoſitors, underſtanding by <hi>Rivers, States, and Kingdomes, by Fountains of waters, the Heads of theſe,</hi> namely, <hi>Kings, Parliaments, Statſmen, &amp;c. upon whom this Vial is poured forth.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe the ordinary uſe of the words give this to be the meaning; For <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Waters</hi> in Scripture-phraſe ſignifie <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> Ezek. 32.2. <hi>Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh King of Egypt, and ſay unto him, Thou art like a young Lion of the Nations, thou cameſt forth with thy Rivers, and troubledſt the waters with thy feet, and fouledſt their Rivers.</hi> Iſa. 8.7. <hi>Now therefore behold, the Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the River ſtrong and many, even the King of Aſſyria.</hi> Rev. 17.15. <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt, where the Whore ſitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues.</hi> The Fountain in common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is as much as the <hi>Head</hi> of a River, whence it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and by which it is nouriſhed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Becauſe the reaſon of the Vial, verſ. 6. <hi>For they

                        <p n="4">4 Becauſe this Interpretation doth make a glorious concurrence and harmony, betwixt the order of Gods workings hitherto (ſince the Vials began to be poured out) and the order of the Vials: For the firſt remarkable thing wherein the hand of God appeared againſt the Beaſt, was in the detection of, and deſtroying his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>doctrine,</hi> and abominable Idolatries. Next pouring contempt upon, and pulling down the <hi>Antichriſtian Hierarchy.</hi> And the very next thing remarkable ſince that, hath been the ſhaking of ſome <hi>Nations,</hi> and removing from their ſeats their <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>great ones,</hi> who were ſecret friends unto, and ſupporters of this Throne of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; accordingly, the firſt came under the <hi>firſt Vial,</hi> the next the <hi>ſecond;</hi> And why may not the <hi>third,</hi> being a thing remarkable, and diſtinct from the other, come under this <hi>third Vial,</hi> we are now ſpeaking of?</p>

                        <p>By <hi>Sun</hi> here cannot be meant (as ſome) Chriſt the Son of Righteouſneſs; nor (as others) the Scripture revealing Chriſt; for the manifeſt truth of our fourth Propoſition,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56286:69"/>as alſo becauſe according to either of theſe opinions) the Subject of this Vial, is made ſingular from all the reſt, for the Subjects of every of the other Vials are things evill, and peeces of Antichriſts and Satans Kingdome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſo to be; but according to theſe interpretations, the Subject of this Vial ſhould be good; either Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or one of the principal things, and of greateſt value pertaining to his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>A late worthy Writer, who interprets this <hi>Sun</hi> to be ſome high, eminent <hi>Head of State,</hi> who like a <hi>Sun</hi> in the Popiſh world upholds all; and by his ſplendor and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giveth ſtrength and luſtre to all; Like as the <hi>Sun</hi> in the created world, by its light and motion, guides and moves the forces of nature; he that hit the mark in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nearl, but not having pointed who, or what this Head is, hath yet left room for a more particular inquiry.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Sun</hi> therefore (as ſome others more fitly and rightly judge) we are in this place to underſtand the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> or <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> but theſe alſo in the application fall under a miſtake, whilſt looking upon the late <hi>German</hi> War to be the Effect of this Vial, they bring us down to the fifth or ſixth Vials; which opinion for our two firſt reaſons laid down to diſprove the very ſame opinion (urged by another Author, and to another end) in opening the Subject of the ſecond Vial, cannot ſtand with truth.</p>
                        <p>And here, by the way, I cannot but give the Reader a hint, how eaſie a thing it is to be deceived by likelihoods; The <hi>German</hi> War having in it the likelihood of a <hi>Vial,</hi> hath given occaſion to ſome to bring it under the ſecond, to others under the fourth, whereas indeed it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to none. Spiritual prudence and direction from above, is wanting in nothing more than this, to judge aright of likelihoods.</p>
                        <p>Yet although in reſpect of the time they ſtep aſide,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56286:69"/>that yet they have judged aright concerning the Subject, is clear; becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> here being to be underſtood of no other <hi>Sun</hi> than that which ſhines in the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> world, or <hi>Popiſh Horizon</hi> (for it is upon that world, and that alone) all the Vials (the two laſt excepted) are to be poured forth) it cannot to any be ſo properly and parly applyed, as to the <hi>German Empire,</hi> or the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> which although for preſent, through the late War, it hath ſuffered an ecclipſe in reſpect of its former luſtre and beauty; yet was it when <hi>Antichriſts</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was in its higheſt altitude, and the top of its glory, the very <hi>Sun,</hi> and glory of that Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>And that which doth yet more ſtrongly confirm me in this conjecture, is, the conſideration how exactly the ſame, according to this interpretation doth agree both to the time and place of the Witneſſes killing, and riſing; for that they about this time lye dead in that ſtreet of the Great City, (the very, and only place they are to be ſlain in) and ſhall ſhortly there ariſe; ſome weighty grounds for proof hereof, are laid down by the worthy <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica,</hi> of whom mention was made in the foregoing <hi>Vial,</hi> to which it were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to adde ſome farther proof, though here to do it would be to make this word by the by, ſwell into a <hi>Tract</hi> of it ſelf, and therefore I forbear, not without ſome hopes and expectations, that inſtead of <hi>verbal,</hi> the thing by <hi>real</hi> Arguments may prove it ſelf ere long.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56286:72"/>in declaring more fully what under the Vials is but briefly hinted at, agrees moſt exactly to this ſenſe, but by the other is broken to pecces; for Chap. 18. relates to <hi>Romes</hi> ruin, and Chap 19. concludes with the battle of <hi>Armageedon,</hi> accordingly the City <hi>Rome</hi> is the Subject of this Vial, and ſuddenly after Ver. 16. comes in the battle of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> whereas if the ruin of the City <hi>Rome</hi> (as judgeth the worthy Author) were not to be till the ſeventh Vial, the order of the Holy Ghoſt in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the 18, 19. which relates the ruin of the City <hi>Rome</hi> before, yet preparation is made to that <hi>battle,</hi> would be manifeſtly broken.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe no interpretation can better-ſute the words themſelves; for what may more properly be called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts Soat,</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> the place where the Chair he ſits in ſtands? or what thing can befall the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which is more likely to fill his whole Kingdom with darkneſs, yea, make the Papals gnaw their tongues for pain, than the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Rome,</hi> the Metropolis of that Kingdom?</p>
                           <p n="4">4 To theſe I may adde a fourth Argument, urged by a learned Writer to our purpoſe. Where the purpled Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſits, there is Antichriſts Seat, becauſe ſhe ſits on the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is, Antichriſt the purpled <hi>Woman</hi> ſits at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſits on the <hi>ſeven Head; of the Beaſt.</hi> which are the <hi>ſeven Mountains of Rome,</hi> Chap. 17.9 <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads are ſeven Mountains, on which the Woman ſitteth. Rome,</hi> therefore is, yea, muſt be the <hi>Seat</hi> of Antichriſt.</p>
                           <p>Now as to the Objection, <hi>That this City Rome comes under the ſeventh Vial,</hi> where mention is made of <hi>Great Babylon</hi> coming into remembrance before God, and that therefore it cannot be the Subject of this. I ſhall to that ſay nothing here, onely refer the Reader to our opening of that place for his anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Neither let any ſay (as ſome object) that this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                           <p>Concerning the time when this Vial ſhall be poured forth, my thoughts are theſe:</p>
                           <p>That the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery being to begin (as in my firſt part hath been proved) in, or about the year 56, and that being the <hi>Effect</hi> of the ſixth, or following <hi>Vial;</hi> it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily follows, that the <hi>Vials</hi> upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> muſt be poured forth ſometime in the interim betwixt this, and the yeer of our Lord, 1656. or thereabouts, and therefore although for ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the particular time, I ſhall wave it, yet may I ſafely conclude thus much in the general, that the time is at hand.</p>
                           <p>Now the Reaſons why ſo <hi>little</hi> time is allowed to theſe two <hi>Vials,</hi> when as every of the former hath taken up much more, are as I conceive:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe God is ſlow in beginning to pour out his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56286:74"/>
                              <hi>wrath</hi> upon ſinners, waiting their <hi>repentance;</hi> but when <hi>wrath</hi> hath been poured out upon them, and they by the ſame grow hardened, then his proceedings are more <hi>quick,</hi> Hence in the firſt Vial, a <hi>long</hi> breathing time to conſider their wayes, is allowed to theſe enemies of God, which they not regarding, but being more <hi>hardned</hi> under it, God in pouring out the ſecond, <hi>cuts</hi> the time much <hi>ſhorter;</hi> yet becauſe under that they are <hi>hardned</hi> alſo, therefore in the third, time is <hi>cut ſhorter yet;</hi> and becauſe after God had ſmitten them <hi>three times</hi> they ſtill are <hi>hardned,</hi> and perſiſt to oppoſe the Lord Jeſus; inſtead of ſubmitting to give him glory, therefore in the fourth and fifth Vials, <hi>time</hi> is brought to a <hi>little ſcantling,</hi> God doing that in a few dayes, which before took up many yeers.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe with the pouring forth of this Vial, the <hi>ſuffering</hi> of the Gentile-Churches (as I conceive) draws to an end (though after this the <hi>Jews</hi> in that interval of time betwixt the ſixt and ſeventh Vials are to have a day of ſuffering.) Now the <hi>nearer</hi> the end comes, the <hi>faſter</hi> will Chriſt go, the finiſhing of the work ſhall be cut <hi>ſhort in righteouſneſs.</hi> And therefore obſervable it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both theſe Vials, that the Scripture hath ſet a mark upon each, to ſhew that their continuance is not to be long. The fourth <hi>Vial</hi> under which the Witneſſes riſe, hath this to note the ſuddenneſs of it; <hi>The ſame hour there was a great Earthquake, and the tenth part of the City fell,</hi> Chap. 11.13. <hi>it is done in an hour, i.e.</hi> in a very ſhort time; and of the fifth <hi>Vial</hi> poured out upon the <hi>City Rome,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Her plagues ſhall come upon her in one day,</hi> Chap. 18.8. and <hi>in one hour is her judgement come,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>in one hour ſo great riches is come to nought,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>in one hour ſhe is made deſolate,</hi> verſ. 19.

                        <p>An eminent late Writer interprets this River <hi>Euphrates</hi> to be the <hi>ſtreams</hi> of <hi>Popiſh corruption,</hi> namely, their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries,</hi> by their <hi>Maſs, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c.</hi> their <hi>murders</hi> of the ſouls of men, as well as the bodies of Chriſts ſervants; their <hi>Sorceries,</hi> of which many of the Popes themſelves were guilty; their <hi>Whoredomes,</hi> namely, in their <hi>Stews;</hi> their <hi>Thefts,</hi> by their <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Pardons</hi> for money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>By <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> We are here to underſtand, the Jews, who upon the pouring forth of this <hi>Vial,</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own Land, and be converted to Chriſt: And I take it that the pouring out of this <hi>Vial,</hi> prepares a way for both, viz. <hi>Their poſſeſſion of their own land again, and their converſion to the Faith of the Goſpel;</hi> For as the latter ſhall not go without the former, I mean <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chriſt, without poſſeſſion of their land</hi> (The Scripture being full and clear in this, that when that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56286:76"/>ſhall be converted, they ſhall be in poſſeſſion of their Land again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.17. and 32.41. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.21, 22, 25. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.14, 15. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2 12.) ſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alone without the latter, would be a thing indeed too low and carnal to be accounted the <hi>ſole moving cauſe</hi> of pouring out this <hi>Vial,</hi> which this preparing a way for the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> is.</p>
                        <p>Now the Jewes are here called <hi>Kings,</hi> either for that abundance of <hi>riches</hi> they ſhall bring along with them at their return, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.9.—<hi>To bring thy Sons from far, their ſilver and their gold with them.</hi> Or rather for that <hi>great honour</hi> and dignity that God will put upon his people, (ſetting them uppermoſt in his Kingdom) upon it, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.8. <hi>And thou O Tower of the flock, the ſtrong hold of the Daughters of</hi> Sion, <hi>unto thee ſhall it come, even the firſt Dominion, the Kingdom ſhall come to the Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem, Iſa. 61.9. <hi>Their ſeed ſhall be known among the Gentiles, and their off-ſpring among the people, all that ſee them, ſhall acknowledge them, that they are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed,</hi> Zech. 8.23. <hi>In thoſe daies ten men ſhall take hold out of all the languages of the Nations, even ſhall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſaying, We will goe with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And they are called, <hi>Kings of the Eaſt</hi> (the Greek reads it, <hi>from the riſing of the Sun</hi>) becauſe (as ſome think) their coming ſhall be from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, which though I do not altogether deny, yet cannot I here ſubſcribe to it, as the reaſon why they are ſo called, becauſe, as this interpretation adheres too much to the letter, ſo it is evident, that the Scriptures which ſpeak of their return, do as well mention their <hi>coming</hi> from other quarters, as from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and not one Scripture ſpeaks of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> alone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43:5. <hi>I will bring thy ſeed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56286:77"/>from the East, and gather them from the Weſt: I will ſay to the North give up, and to the South keep not back, bring my Sons from far, and my Daughters from the ends of the Earth,</hi> Chap. 49.12. <hi>Behold, theſe ſhall come from far, and loe theſe from the North, and from the Weſt, and theſe from the Land of</hi> Sinim. Jer. 31.8. <hi>Behold I will bring them from the North Country, &amp; gather them from the coaſts of the earth,</hi>— Zech. 8.7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, behold I will ſave my people from the Eaſt Country, and from the Weſt Country, and I will bring them, and they ſhall dwel in the midſt of Jeruſalem.</hi> But rather following the Greek, <hi>Kings from the riſing of the Sun.</hi> I take it they may be ſo called, becauſe then they ſhall come to this great <hi>preferment, honor, and dignity,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe,</hi> whoſe riſing, that it ſhall be upon the pouring forth of this <hi>Vial</hi> (before the laſt is poured forth) ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Now God in his wonderful and unſearchable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſo order it, as that at the appointed time of the Jews return, the power and multitude of the Grand Signeur (who is now the greateſt Monarch in the world, and holds their Land in poſſeſſion) ſhall be much waſted and conſumed, and that in ſuch a way, by ſuch means and inſtruments, that as the one, viz. <hi>The waſting of the Great Turks Power, ſhall ſet open a door for the Jews to poſſeſs their own Land,</hi> ſo the other, viz. <hi>the way, means or inſtruments by which this ſhall be done, ſhall be a special help and furtherance to their receiving of the Goſpel, and Chriſt for their true Meſſiah;</hi> and ſo indeed the pouring out of this Vial upon the <hi>Great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Euphrates</hi> ſhall prepare a way (as hath been ſaid) both for their poſſeſſion of their own Land, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſt, both which to take in here is much better (I conceive) and more agreeable to the mind of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56286:77"/>Holy Ghoſt, than to limit and ſtraiten the ſame to any one onely.</p>
                        <p>Now that the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſpoken of under this Vial, whoſe converſion we are to expect before the pouring out of the ſeventh, is clear.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> converſion being a thing ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as nothing more, and this to be in the very laſt ages of the world, it cannot be thought that in the <hi>Vials,</hi> (which is a Prophetical Hiſtory in ſhort, of things to be tranſacted in the laſt times) the ſame ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted, which yet in caſe it be not here ſpoken of, is,</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. (which Chapter is but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the two laſt Vials) the <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> to his <hi>Bride</hi> (which Bride can be no other than the General Aſſembly of the faithful ones, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted to Chriſt, among which the <hi>Jews</hi> (as elder Siſter) are chief, and therefore particularly ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4 5. <hi>and</hi> 54.4.5, 6. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.) is made an immediate <hi>forerunner</hi> of the <hi>battel of Armageddon,</hi> as compare ver. 7, 8, 9. with 19.20.21. with which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the ſeventh Vial beginning, (for what is done before the pouring out of the ſeventh, is onely a preparation to it) the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Bride</hi> muſt neceſſarily be before the ſeventh Vial is poured forth. He who deſireth further light as to this Argument, may at his leaſure read over the 37 38, 39, Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the third of <hi>Joel,</hi> and the 12, 13, 14, th.

                           <hi>Revelations,</hi> and that is chap 21.5, 6. <hi>He that ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne ſaid, Behold I make all things new. And he ſaid unto me, it is done;</hi> here it is applied to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> noting the meaning of the phraſe to be this, <hi>Now is the New Jeruſalem eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,</hi> and how ſhould this be, in caſe the Jews the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and principal Inhabitants of this <hi>new City,</hi> were yet to be converted?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, the words ſpeak not of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> but onely <hi>preparing a way</hi> thereto.</p>
                        <p>I grant it, the pouring out of this Vial, doth onely <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way</hi> as to their <hi>Converſion to Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>Converſion</hi> of theirs is to be (for the fore-mentioned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) in the <hi>Interval</hi> of time betwixt the ſixt and ſeventh Vials.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Whereas it is further objected, That the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of the Jews cannot be until ſuch time as the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> is poured forth, becauſe Chap 15.8. it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>No man could enter into the Temple, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To that I anſwer, That this doth as well exclude the <hi>Converſion of Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> all the time the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are pouring forth, as <hi>Jews,</hi> and who will affirm that? ſo long as daily experience hath, and (bleſſed be the Lord) doth prove the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Some other interpretation muſt therefore be given of this Scripture, to free it from ſuch an aſſertion and whether doth not this ſuite the place well, which alſo ſerves to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work of pouring out the <hi>Vials,</hi> by putting life and courage into the Angels which are to do it? to wit, <hi>That the glorious and powerful preſence of God in his Temple, all the time the Vials ſhould be in pouring forth</hi> (which is here ſet forth by <hi>ſmoak,</hi> alluding to that cloud covering the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. and filling <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> 1 King. 8.10. which was a ſign of Gods ſpecial preſence then) <hi>ſhould be ſuch,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56286:78"/>that [no man] that is, none of the Antichriſtian party, no nor any other</hi> (for he ſpeaks not here of men as <hi>worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.11. but of men as <hi>enemies</hi> to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and Gods <hi>work</hi> in it) <hi>[ſhould be able]</hi> i.e. <hi>by force or power [to enter into the Temple]</hi> i. e. <hi>to deſtroy the Templers, and thereby put a ſtop to the work, Gods power and preſence being in the Temple, to aſſiſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in carrying it on [until the ſeven Plagues of the ſeven Angels ſhould be fulfilled]</hi> i.e. <hi>never, for if they cannot hinder the work till it is wholly effected, they ſhall never do it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Whereas it is further objected, that the whole 21, and 22 Chapters of this Book, which are the events of the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> do hold forth this of the <hi>Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> which therefore ſeems rather to be an <hi>Effect</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> than to go before it.</p>
                        <p>To that I anſwer, That the main thing ſpoken of in thoſe Chapters, is their <hi>glory,</hi> not their <hi>converſion.</hi> Now that I readily grant, that their <hi>glory</hi> (which is a fruit and conſequent of their <hi>Converſion</hi>) ſhall have a <hi>cloud</hi> upon it, and not be <hi>conſpicuous</hi> till the <hi>battle of Armageddon</hi> be over, and the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> poured out; but their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> ſhall be before, for Chap. 19.8. tells us that the <hi>Bride</hi> is in her <hi>fine linnen,</hi> whilſt yet preparation is but making to this <hi>battle,</hi> and the pouring out of the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, The very Argument uſed by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author of theſe objections (in opening verſ. 16. of this Chapter) to prove the <hi>Jews converſion</hi> from the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> Chap. 19. which being an Hebrew word ſeems to imply the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the Jews at this time (who together (ſaith our Author) with the <hi>Gentile-Churches</hi> praiſe God for <hi>Romes</hi> deſtruction) makes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt his own opinion, <hi>viz. That the Jews ſhall not be called till all the Vials are poured out;</hi> for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56286:79"/>ſinging <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> Chap. 19. is before, yet preparation is made to the battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as from the ſequel of the Chapter is clear; and this precedency is not only in words, but a precedency in time, for the ſinging <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> is inſtantly upon <hi>Romes</hi> ruine, whereas the battel of <hi>Armageddon</hi> (which yet is included within the <hi>Vials</hi>) is not to be till ſome yeers after.</p>

                        <p>If it ſhould enter into the thoughts of any to conceive the <hi>Angel</hi> here to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who either by ſome <hi>immediate</hi> hand from Heaven ſhould <hi>dry</hi> up the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power, or by ſome <hi>ſecret</hi> judgement ſhould cauſe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion amongſt his ſubjects, or (as before) a diverſion of his force ſome other way, thereby opening a door to the <hi>Jews</hi> to recover their own Land, I ſhould to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that this were to make the <hi>Angel</hi> of this Vial different from all the reſt, for every of the other Vials have ſome viſible <hi>Angel</hi> pouring of them out, but according hereunto the <hi>Angel</hi> of this Vial ſhould be inviſible only.</p>

                        <p>With this laſt my thoughts accord, becauſe upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch, I can find no opinion elſe that will either agree with the Text, or with it ſelf.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 It is moſt likely, <hi>That the ſame Angel, or thoſe very Inſtruments which ſhall ruin</hi> Rome, <hi>ſhall alſo pour out this Vial upon the great River Euphrates,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>ſtone</hi> that ſmites the feet of the Image (<hi>i.e.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt) is the ſame with the <hi>four Carpenters,</hi> who are to fray the Horns (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Turkiſh Power) lift up over the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now becauſe it will be ſaid, That it is as hard a thing for us, as yet, to find who this <hi>Angel</hi> ſhall be, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for till we ſee <hi>Rome</hi> deſtroyed, who knows who ſhall do the thing? I anſwer, would you know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments before you ſee them at <hi>Romes</hi> Gates, obſerve then the <hi>rolling ſtone,</hi> and look for them there where you ſee that: For this is moſt certain, that as the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is to be broken in peeces by no other force or power, but onely that of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> ſo there where the <hi>ſtone</hi> is firſt taken out of the mountains, and formed together by God, and begins to <hi>roll</hi> and ſmite, out of that quarter, may we conclude the Tempeſt (though yet it be a great way off) which is to fall upon <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall moſt certainly come; for obſerve it, though the <hi>ſtone</hi> by <hi>rolling</hi> grows greater and greater, yet is it that <hi>ſtone</hi> ſtill, and not another, which was formed together at firſt; whereas if the ſame matter which formed together did make the <hi>ſtone</hi> at firſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56286:83"/>were wholly to be laid aſide, though matter of the ſame kind ſhould ſtill be uſed, yet would it be a new <hi>ſtone,</hi> a <hi>ſtone</hi> new formed; but the ſame <hi>ſtone</hi> that ſmites at firſt, and not another, is that which breaks in peeces the great Image, though this <hi>ſtone,</hi> whilſt it is in doing of it, is ſtill in a growing poſture; by means whereof as it <hi>rolls</hi> further and further, ſo may it have much more matter added daily to it, yet is it the ſame <hi>ſtone</hi> ſtill, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtrength of the ſtone lies principally in that matter, which was formed together at firſt, that being the Baſis or foundation of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>And this confirmes our firſt and main Propoſition, viz. <hi>That the Gentile Chriſtians ſhall pour out this Vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Turk,</hi> becauſe the very ſame ſtone, which begins to ſmite the Image on his feet, is to break the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>i.e.</hi> all worldly Powers.</p>

Tarſhiſh</hi> was a place very conſiderable for <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Shipping</hi> in time of old, for which reaſon the Scripture never ſpeaks of great ſhips, ſtrong ſhips, or multitude of ſhips, but they are called by the name of the <hi>Ships of Tarſhiſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.25.

                        <p>Fourthly, What if I ſay, they ſhall be a people <hi>under a State Government,</hi> for ſuch a kind of <hi>Government</hi> of old had the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> the power of <hi>Government</hi> among them reſiding not in <hi>one man,</hi> but in <hi>many,</hi> which in Scripture are called the <hi>Lords of the Philiſtims.</hi> Now this people who ſhall aſſiſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, are <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.14. likened to the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> of old <hi>(they ſhall flye upon the ſhoulders of the Philiſtims)</hi> how? not in <hi>qualities</hi> or <hi>conditions,</hi> for the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were ever <hi>enemies</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and theſe are <hi>friends,</hi> but rather in the <hi>form of their Government;</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned</hi> by a <hi>State;</hi> ſo ſhall <hi>theſe.</hi> Theſe are the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, let the Reader refuſe, or apply them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe the thing aimed at in pouring forth this <hi>Vial,</hi> concerns the <hi>Jews</hi> more eſpecially, and their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration</hi> (as hath appeared in our Diſcourſe hitherto) and becauſe the thoughts of good men are various, and their notions and conceptions very different in the point of the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt <hi>ſtirring,</hi> ſome conceiving the ſame to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Civil</hi> account only, to recover their Country, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56286:84"/>their <hi>converſion</hi> to be ſome years after: Others judging that they ſhall at the firſt be converted to the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and their <hi>ſtirring</hi> to ariſe from that; the right underſtanding of which myſtery, is a thing of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance (either opinion having ſeemingly much footing in the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament) as that without ſome further light, then as yet I have ſeen, the Prophecies relating to this people, and the time of their return, cannot be brought to a joynt concurrence and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony one with another; I ſhall therefore (not boaſting of any light that I have above others, having reaſon enough to be otherwiſe minded; but as one willing, with others, to ſeek after, and if it may be, to find the truth) offer here (in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe) and that in as few words as I can, my own preſent thoughts concerning the thing, which are,</p>
                        <p>That the firſt <hi>ſtirring</hi> or <hi>moving</hi> of this people ſhall be (as I conceive) from ſome <hi>notable work</hi> of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>hearts</hi> of ſome, who ſhall at this day be <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> ones, or <hi>Leaders</hi> amongſt them, working in them a ſincere, earneſt, and longing deſire to find the Lord their God: Hereupon ariſing themſelves, and ſtirring up others to ariſe with them, now to go unto <hi>Sion,</hi> unto the Lord their God, which we have, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.6. <hi>For there ſhall be a day, that the Watchmen upon the Mount of Ephraim</hi> (who was head of the ten Tribes, for which reaſon the Reſtauration here ſpoken of, muſt be their laſt, which is yet to come) <hi>ſhall ſay, Ariſe yee, and let us go up to Sion, unto the Lord our God,</hi> and verſ. 9. wee have the manner of their coming, <hi>They ſhall come with weeping, and with ſupplication will I lead them:</hi> Qualifications not proper to ſuch perſons who move only upon a Civil account, and for worldly ends. So Chap. 50.4, 5. (ſpeaking of the frame they ſhall be in, whilſt as yet they are but upon the way) <hi>In thoſe dayes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56286:85"/>and at that time, ſaith the Lord, if the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Judah to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, going and weeping; They ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall ask the way to Sion, with their faces thitherward, ſaying, Come, and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> Which Text was not fulfilled in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Babylon,</hi> when <hi>Judah</hi> only, not <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together, did return, but manifeſtly looks to their laſt Reſtauration, ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.11. we have a contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, arguing the inward joy and delight they ſhall have in this journey, from conſidering whither, and about what they are going, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Sion</hi> to ſeek their Lord, <hi>The redeemed of the Lord ſhall return, and come with ſinging unto Sion, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads.</hi> So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. (they go ſeeking the Lord) <hi>Afterwards ſhall the children of Iſrael return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King, and they ſhall fear the Lord, and his goodneſs</hi> (When?) <hi>in the latter dayes.</hi> Chap. 1.10, 11. at their beginning to ſtir, before yet they are come forth the place of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſhall be called the children of the living God. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there ſhall it be ſaid unto them, ye are the Sons of the living God. Then ſhall the children of Judah, and the children of Iſrael be gathered together, and appoint themſelves one head, and they ſhall come up out of the land; for great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now thoſe amongſt them who from ſuch an inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and principle, ſhall move themſelves, and put others upon it ſhall be (as I conceive) perſons under a ſtate of <hi>true converſion</hi> to God, being now delivered from the <hi>curſe</hi> before they lay under, and that <hi>hardneſs</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was upon them, though the particular Revelation of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56286:85"/>Chriſt, as come in the fieſh ſhall not as yet be manifeſted to them; but with a ſtrong breathing after the Lord; and a general faith in the Meſſiah, whom they ſhall truly beleeve in, look for, but as to come, they ſhall now go <hi>ſeeking after the Lord, and David</hi> (or Chriſt) their <hi>King;</hi> and this faith of theirs though for want of New-Teſtament light, it be not a New-Teſtament faith (<hi>i.e.</hi> a faith in Chriſt as come already) yet ſhall the ſame be true faith, though running in the Old Teſtament way, (they having yet no higher light) for ſuch was the faith of Gods people of old, before Chriſt came, a looking to the Meſſiah which was to come, acknowledging their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be only from him, and earneſtly breathing and longing after the day of his appearance.</p>
                        <p>And theſe perſons who ſhall have already this true <hi>ſaving work</hi> begun in them ſhall by <hi>converſe with,</hi> and <hi>beholding</hi> the <hi>holineſs, grace,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> of thoſe Gentile Chriſtians, who ſhall be inſtruments to help them in their land, have a <hi>farther work</hi> wrought in them, and upon them (and that before Chriſts appearance to them) namely, they ſhall be convinced that the Meſſias is come, being that Jeſus which was Crucified by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall ſo affect them, as that they ſhall begin to own the crucified Jeſus for Lord and Chriſt; and this I think the rather, becauſe I find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeming to intimate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. that the Jews ſhall be provoked (<hi>i.e.</hi> with a holy provocation) by the Gentiles; Yea verſ. 30, 31. (having before ſpoken of their Call, verſ. 26. <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved</hi>) he tells us plainly, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>rejecting</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel at firſt, did make way for the ſame to be brought to, and preached among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſo the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by having the mercy of the Goſpel amongſt them, ſhall (when the appointed time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> converſion to Chriſt is come) be a <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> obtaining this mercy
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56286:86"/>again, <hi>For as yee in times paſt have not beleeved God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbeleef; even ſo have theſe alſo now not beleeved, that through your mercy, they alſo may obtain mercy;</hi> And which ſtrengthens this perſwaſion, I find <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. (as hath been before obſerved) the Bride to be in her <hi>fine linnen</hi> made ready to receive, and meet her Bridegroom, and that before his appearance, or coming forth to battel upon the white Horſe.</p>
                        <p>But now though there ſhall be many amongſt them, who ſhall from ſuch ends and principles move, as have been before declared, yet ſhall there alſo with theſe march a great multitude, who moved from no work upon their heart, ſhall yet go with the reſt, either led to it by perſwaſion, example, or ſome carnal ends, or hopes of their own; as it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, at their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> firſt, and <hi>Babylon</hi> afterwards (both which were eminent Types of this deliverance) theſe being ſtill in their hardneſs, their former ſtate of ſin and bondage, ſhall not be able to bear the glorious Goſpel Revelation of Chriſt crucified to be their Meſſiah, but ſhall ſtumble at it, kick againſt it, and againſt ſuch of their brethren who receive it.</p>
                        <p>This we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. <hi>He ſhall be for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the Houſes of Iſrael, for a gin, and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem;</hi> which, that it ſpeaks of this time is clear, not only for the reaſon, that it is about the time in which the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> as ſhall appear hereafter, the great <hi>Turk,</hi> who now poſſeſſeth what did anciently belong to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy) is to overflow the land of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> yea and then too, when the ſame ſhall be <hi>Immanuels</hi> land, that is, when Chriſt ſhall begin of the <hi>Jews</hi> to bee known and worſhipped there, as verſ. 7.8. but alſo becauſe it is ſaid in the words, <hi>He ſhall be a ſtone of ſtumbling
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56286:86"/>to both the Houſes of Iſrael, i.e.</hi> to ſome of the ten Tribes, and ſome of the two both, who ſhall at this day be reunited, which never yet hath been. And theſe are the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.38. which ſhall be amongſt Gods people at this day, when they are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all Countries, as were <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> in the dayes of old, upon the coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea theſe ſhall bee they who immediately before the time of Chriſts appearance ſhall <hi>hate</hi> their Brethren (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch among them who tremble at the word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which by the <hi>Gentile-Saints,</hi> they ſhall have had ſome light into, and caſt them out for Chriſts name ſake, whom now they own) who ſhall at the coming of Chriſt bee aſhamed, when he ſhall appear to the others joy, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (ſpeaking of the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> Call, Chriſts coming, and the ſetting up of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>) tells us, Chap. 66.5. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word, your Brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified, but he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea theſe are they who in the laſt and great day of the battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> which <hi>Zechary</hi> ſpeaks of, Chap. 14. ſhall ſome of them <hi>even joyn hands,</hi> (they ſhall bee ſo horridly vile) againſt the reſt of their Fellow-brethren, and that with thoſe who from all parts of the World ſhall bee gathered together againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as verſ. 14. <hi>And Judah alſo ſhall fight at,</hi> (or againſt) <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as did part of thoſe who in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> conſpire with <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah,</hi> and the reſt of the enemies of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> againſt godly <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brethren.</p>

                        <p>And in regard of this <hi>mixt</hi> multitude which ſhall bee amongſt them when they <hi>ſtir, Daniel</hi> ſetting forth this their ſtirring by a Reſutrection, Chap. 12.2.

                        </p>
                        <p>Now becauſe (as I have ſaid) amongſt thoſe who come up to their Land, the greater part ſhall be found not truly ſeeking the Lord, but their own things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by that time they are ſettled in their Land, (and probably, the <hi>Gentile-Chriſtian</hi> removed from them,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56286:87"/>or returned home) ſhall a <hi>fearful ſtorm,</hi> ſuch a day as never was from the <hi>foundation of the world,</hi> fall upon them (which <hi>Daniel</hi> mentions, Chap. 12.1. and <hi>Zech.</hi> Chap. 14.1.) by which as the better part ſhall bee brought through the <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>purified,</hi> and their <hi>faith</hi> tryed; ſo ſhall the other <hi>fall off,</hi> (as before) to the Enemy, or be <hi>cut off</hi> by this day of trouble, ſo that a remnant onely ſhall bee left, which remnant ſhall bee the Holy Seed, which wee have, <hi>Zecha.</hi> 13.8, 9. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe that in all the Land, ſaith the Lord, two parts therein ſhall be cut off, and dye, but the third ſhall be left therein. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refined, and will try them as gold is tryed, they ſhall call on my Name, and I will hear them, I will ſay, It is my people, and they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God,</hi> Iſa. 10.20, 21, 22. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the remnant of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſuch as are eſcaped of the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord, the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in truth.

And alſo the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> for it is upon the ſeven <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Woman ſits, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17 9. <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State.</hi> So that <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Seat</hi> both of the <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State;</hi> and therefore the Beaſt Vial 2. whoſe <hi>Seat</hi> is in <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56286:89"/>of <hi>both States, Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> both which make up but one Beaſt, or Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9 11. Chap. 15.2. Chap. 20.4. in all which places we have but one <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſpoken of, but the ſame as having a <hi>Mark,</hi> and an <hi>Image,</hi> which for what I ſaid but now muſt be interpreted of <hi>both States,</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The like we have Chap. 11.7. <hi>The Beaſt that aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the bottomleſs pit ſhall make war againſt them, i.e.</hi> againſt the two Witneſſes. Now this <hi>Beaſt</hi> aſcending out of the bottomleſs pit is meant of both <hi>States,</hi> not onely for this reaſon, that <hi>both</hi> joyn in ſlaying the Witneſſes, but becauſe Chap. 17.8. we have it ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; for <hi>John</hi> being ſhewn firſt <hi>either</hi> State <hi>diſtinct</hi> verſ. 3, 4. 5, 6. the one repreſented by a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the other by a <hi>Woman</hi> riding upon this <hi>Beast,</hi> in verſ. 7, 8. hath the myſtery of both together ſhewed him and <hi>both</hi> together are the <hi>Beaſt</hi> aſcending out of the bottomleſs Pit, which <hi>Beaſt</hi> there ſpoken of in ſuch various and ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phraſes, <hi>was, is not, yet is, ſhall aſcend out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit,</hi> can be underſtood of no other but <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in all, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The dwellers on the Earth ſhall wonder when they behold the Beaſt that was, is not, and yet is;</hi> noting thus much, that <hi>the dwellers on Earth,</hi> as yet ſaw not this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> for indeed his riſe was not yet, <hi>John</hi> ſeeing the riſe of this Beaſt, Chap. 13.1.11. as a thing to be after his time. Yet is he called the Beaſt [<hi>that was</hi>] becauſe in reſpect of that <hi>Civil</hi> Power this <hi>Beast</hi> ſhould exerciſe, and the <hi>Seat</hi> he ſhould upon his riſe ſit in, he ſhould not differ from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire that then was, and had its beginning long before <hi>John</hi> wrote <hi>[is not]</hi> in reſpect of a power <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as well as <hi>Civil,</hi> which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was to have; ſo he <hi>was not,</hi> the preſent Government when <hi>John</hi> wrote, neither knowing, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any ſuch power; for which cauſe though <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56286:90"/>Seat</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Power; was in the Roman Empire as Pagan, yet was not the Empire or Government then the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here ſpoken of, or <hi>Antichriſt. [Yet is]</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of will and deſire, and a ſecret aſpiring which then was after ſuch a thing or power, which once obtained, would Midwife this man of ſin into the world, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The myſtery of iniquity doth already work,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.18. <hi>Even now there are many Antichriſts [ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit]</hi> becauſe the <hi>riſe</hi> of this <hi>Beaſt</hi> (which muſt, as I have ſaid, be one and the ſame in all the ſeveral expreſſions) was to be afterwards, when the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> power that now was in the hands of Pagan Emperors ſhould fall into the hands of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and withall an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> power ſet up with it, <hi>both</hi> going together hand in hand, which ſhould be a Government ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that it is ſaid to <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit, i.e.</hi> the riſe of it ſhould be as from Hell it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>And therefore of this very <hi>Beaſt</hi> that <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he is the eight,</hi> verſ. 11. that is the eighth kind of Government which ſhould be in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (a clear Argument that not the Empire in general, but the ſame as under Antichriſtian onely, is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is not:</hi> for all the ſeveral Governments are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Empire in general, but the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> is ſpoken of particularly, as but one, and that too the <hi>eight</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> which can agree to none but Antichriſt) for five diſtinct kinds of Government had been before <hi>Johns</hi> time.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56286:90"/>ſaith, <hi>when he commeth he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace;</hi> for indeed this continued but a little while, but the Empire growing corrupt, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> i.e. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> creeps in; who is called the <hi>eight, And the Beaſt that was and is not, even he is the eight</hi> — verſ. 11. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſets up a new form of Government diſtinct from all the former, viz. an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> State mixt together, which none of the former Governments had; and may therefore well then be called <hi>the eight,</hi> or another Government. <hi>And yet he is of the ſeven, and is of the ſeven — i.e.</hi> beſides the new <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Power erected by this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> this <hi>Beaſt</hi> doth alſo exerciſe that <hi>Civil</hi> Power which the <hi>ſeven,</hi> or the ſeveral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before him had, or did exerciſe. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ver. 9. are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ſeven kinds of Government, ver. 10. Not to ſhew that by <hi>Beaſt</hi> is underſtood (as is generally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) the Empire at large, including all the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that were to be in it: But to ſhew that the power of all the ſeven former Governments ſhould center in this Beaſt, whatſoever Civil power they had, he ſhould have it all, who yet over and above ſhould erect a new power, which none of the former had, in which ſenſe he ſhould be <hi>the eighth.</hi> And of this <hi>Beaſt</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he goeth into perdition,</hi> either becauſe deſtruction will be his end, as chap. 19.20. or becauſe under this <hi>Beaſt</hi> the <hi>Fourth Monarchy</hi> is to be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>So that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here aſcending out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, (which is the ſame <hi>Beaſt</hi> with that which kils the Witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1.) is to be underſtood of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> both, of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire as now it is: though of the ſeven in reſpect of the <hi>Political State,</hi> and yet the <hi>eight</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> added to the other, yet but one and the ſame Beaſt, for the ſame Beaſt is the <hi>eight,</hi> and of the <hi>ſeven.</hi> I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56286:91"/>therefore conclude, that Beaſt, when ſpoken of without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, denotes Antichriſts Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power both.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Beaſt</hi> is ſpoken of <hi>with distinction,</hi> as <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Beaſt; Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>Woman; Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi> We are then by <hi>one</hi> to underſtand the Roman Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil State onely, by the <hi>other,</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is manifeſt <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. where we have <hi>two Beaſts</hi> ſpoken of, the <hi>one</hi> ariſing out of the Sea, ver. 2. the <hi>other</hi> out of the Earth, verſ. 11. By the firſt, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Civil State</hi> onely, for verſ. 2. The <hi>Dragon</hi> gives to this <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> his power, <hi>Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> i.e. the <hi>Devil,</hi> who all the time the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was <hi>Pagan,</hi> did <hi>rule</hi> in it, and was openly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped there, ſeeing himſelf by Chriſtian Emperors, now come to the Imperial Dignity, dethroned, ſo as that he cannot under that form procure any more as he had done, to be openly worſhipped, and to perſecute the Saints; he therefore reſigns his <hi>Power, Seat, and great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> (i.e. <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Empire, and the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the former Emperors, which was Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil onely) to this <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> for which reaſon the <hi>ſeven heads of the Antichriſtian Beast,</hi> Chap. 17.9.10. are by the Holy Ghoſt interpreted firſt. Of the ſeven <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> And ſecondly, of the <hi>ſeven diſtinct</hi> kinds of Government, namely, the Power and Authority of the Beaſt, becauſe both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Civil power</hi> of the former Empire, are given into the hands of this <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> (the principal limb of Antichriſt) ſo that by <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Civil State</hi> onely is to be underſtood, for the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the <hi>Dragon reſigns,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> could reſign no more; the <hi>power</hi> of the former Empire, in which the <hi>Dragon</hi> ruled, being <hi>Civil</hi> onely.</p>
                        <p>But ſo ſubtle is this <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> that by <hi>reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56286:91"/>to the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> a <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> doth ariſe, verſ. 11. by which Beaſt the Devil obtains to be worſhipped again, though under a more ſpecious form and devout way of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, deviſed by the <hi>ſecond Beaſt;</hi> and ſo what the Devil was before forced to let go, in one kind, he now by policy gets again in another. Now this <hi>ſecond Beast</hi> is the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> of the Roman Empire, the Pope his Hierarchy and Clergy, as appears:</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe his riſe is out of the Earth,</hi> verſ. 11. that is, his beginning is <hi>baſe, mean,</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> as the Popes at firſt, (when the Beaſt firſt began to riſe) were poor Biſhops, who in time by the favour of Princes got up to be Popes, and moſt of their exalted Clergy-men riſe out of the dung.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>He looks like a Lamb,</hi> as the Pope calls himſelf Chriſts Vicar, the Servant of the Servants of Chriſt, and his retinue pretend humility, and their power to be from, and for Chriſt, and hold their ſtation ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles, as he doth his from <hi>Peter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>He ſpeaks like a Dragon.</hi> The Pope, and all they who derive their power from him, though he and they look ever ſo like Saints, yet the abſoluteneſs of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Injunctions and Impoſitions, enforcing and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Conſciences of all, declare them to be the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that is, the perſecutor of the Woman, or Chriſts flock, as the <hi>Dragon</hi> is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 <hi>He exerciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt,</hi> Verſ. 12. As the Pope hath a double ſword, a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and a ſpiritual; and his inferior Clergy make uſe of a Civil Power to uphold their own cauſe, as well as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas ſome conceive the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> here to be the <hi>whole body</hi> of the Roman Empire, as the ſame is the fourth Monarchy, whereof the Antichriſt is but a part; and the ſecond Beaſt to be the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56286:92"/>alone, it cannot ſo be; partly for the Reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, and further, becauſe according to this, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould continue to make war againſt the Saints, and to kill them above two and forty months, for recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time of the ten Perſecutions, and all the time ſince, in which war hath been made upon the Saints, and they killed, it amounts to much more than two and forty months, which yet is the limited time of this Beaſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. Verſ. 5. <hi>And power was given unto him to continue two and forty months.</hi> Yea, then how comes it to paſs that this <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> differs from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who yet did repreſent the former Empire, for whereas the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> (as one well obſerves) hath but ſeven Crowns, and thoſe ſeven upon his Head, Chap. 12.3. this <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath ten Crowns, and thoſe upon his Horns, verſ. 1. which difference according to this Principle ſhould not bee, for they ſhould be one and the ſame: Therefore the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> is the Empire only as under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and of that (as I have ſaid) the <hi>Civil</hi> ſtate onely, as the ſecond the <hi>Ecceleſiaſtical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore as concerning theſe <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> we are not to conceive, as though they ſprung up at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> one a good while after the other, for the continuance of the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> (I have ſaid already) is to be but two and forty months, and ſo much time is allowed to <hi>both</hi> the Beaſts, Chap. 11.12. <hi>the holy City ſhall they</hi> (<hi>i e.</hi> both the Beaſts) <hi>tread underfoot two and forty months.</hi> And indeed the treading the Holy City underfoot two and forty months can be no other act, but the act of the Beaſt, it agreeing ſo punctually to be the preciſe time of his Reign. And of what Beaſt?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, That very <hi>Beaſt</hi> mentioned, verſ. 7. which ariſeth out of the <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and towards the end of this time kills the Witneſſes; which Beaſt I have already ſhewed to be ſpoken of <hi>both the Beaſts,</hi> viz. the <hi>Civil</hi>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56286:92"/>and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſtate, whoſe riſe therefore muſt be together, the time of eithers Reign being two and forty months. For indeed ſo ſoon as the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which before was <hi>Pagan,</hi> but now Chriſtian, began to be ſo corrupt as to be the <hi>firſt Beaſt, i. e.</hi> of Chriſtian an Antichriſtian ſtate, perſecuting the true members of Chriſt, inſtantly with this corrupted ſtate did the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> ariſe; that is, the ſword and power of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate which before was uſed by none but himſelf, came now to be in the hands, or at the will and diſpoſal of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> perſons, Church-men (as they are called) that theſe thereby might become fit inſtruments to ſet up, and eſtabliſh their own Idolatries, and perſecute the Saints; And by this aroſe a <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> exerciſing by permiſſion all the Power of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and is therefore ſaid to exerciſe it <hi>before him,</hi> verſ. 12. in his <hi>ſight,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>i.e.</hi> by leave or permiſſion of the <hi>firſt Beaſt;</hi> for which cauſe, the making war with the Saints, verſ. 7. the compelling all Nations that dwell upon the earth to worſhip the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> verſ. 8. is appropriated to the firſt <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as though it were his act, whereas indeed it is properly the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> doth this, as is clear, verſ. 15 16, 17. but hee doth it by exerciſing the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> without which he could not do it; and therefore the ſame thing is recorded in deſcribing either <hi>Beaſt,</hi> becauſe in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> is the firſt mover, but the effecting of it, is done by the power of the <hi>firſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> may well be called another <hi>Beast,</hi> diſtinct from the firſt, notwithſtanding the power he exerciſeth by the power of the firſt, becauſe the hands this power is now put into, or is at the diſpoſal of, are ſuch as not only are without right to this power, but alſo never had until this day any ſuch power intruſted in them, or at their diſpoſal.</p>
                        <p>Yet that theſe <hi>Beaſts,</hi> though <hi>two,</hi> are indeed <hi>one,</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56286:93"/>make up but <hi>one</hi> Antichriſt is clear, becauſe <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi> riſe together, as before; <hi>both</hi> are alike in nature, actions, and conditions, for both are <hi>filthy Beaſts,</hi> and cruel Tyrants, <hi>both</hi> Patrons of Idolatry, <hi>both</hi> bloody Perſecutors of the Saints, <hi>both</hi> are helpful one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> communicates of his <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> verſ. 12. the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> gives <hi>life</hi> to the <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>firſt Beaſt;</hi> verſ. 15. yea verſ. 18. <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> number is aſſigned to <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and the number of <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>th</hi> the Beaſts in concluſion of the Viſion, is but the <hi>number</hi> of the Beaſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> of one Beaſt. <hi>Here is wiſdome, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the</hi> Beaſt; Which alſo addes a beam of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light for the clearing of what I have ſaid before; that Beaſt, when ſpoken of <hi>without</hi> diſtinction, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſtate both. So that in fine the reſult is, <hi>They are two</hi> Beaſts, <hi>as a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and an Eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and yet but one</hi> Beaſt, <hi>as Antichriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What I have ſaid of theſe <hi>two</hi> Beaſts, I may ſay the <hi>ſame</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Woman,</hi> Chap. 17. The <hi>Beast</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> rides upon, is the <hi>Civil</hi> ſtate, the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> riding upon this <hi>Beast</hi> is the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> only with this difference, the <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> Chap. 13. who upon his firſt riſe was a Beaſt, aſpiring to no higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and exerciſing the power of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> ſtate, by leave as it were, through permiſſion of the firſt Beaſt, is now through a long ſtanding riſen from a <hi>Beaſt</hi> to a <hi>Woman,</hi> as diſdaining to be in ſo low a degree as a Beaſt any longer. Yea, ſuch a <hi>Woman</hi> as like a <hi>notorious</hi> Strumpet knows how to make the Kings of the Earth, yea the whole world follow her dance, and crouch to her, by which ſhe is grown rich and gallant, having by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and jugling, got the riches, the gold, the precious ſtones, and pearls of the <hi>first Beaſt</hi> to her ſelf, and to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56286:93"/>ſhew what an aſpiring ſpirit ſhe is of, inſtead now of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the power of the <hi>firſt Beaſt, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Civil State,</hi> by leave any longer, ſhe is now like Lord and King got upon the back of the firſt <hi>Beaſt,</hi> who dares not croſs her humor, for ſhe rides him and rules him at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                        <p>And indeed the firſt Beaſt is juſtly recompenced for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up and countenancing ſuch a Beaſt at firſt, who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb) give an inch of power, he will take an ell; for whilſt the firſt Beaſt remains a Beaſt ſtill, this ſecond Beaſt is from a Beaſt advanced to be a <hi>Woman,</hi> which not onely had robbed and plundered the coffers of the Beaſt, and got all his riches from him, but alſo knows how to ride the Beaſt, maſter him, and rule him as ſhe liſt.</p>
                        <p>And certainly had not the firſt Beaſt been a very Beaſt, I mean, had not the <hi>Civil State</hi> at firſt ſo far degenerated, as inſtead of acting rationally as a <hi>man,</hi> to act ſenſually and bruitiſhly as a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> this great inconvenience would have been foreſeen in the beginning, at leaſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in time, before the ſecond Beaſt was grown to ſuch a height, that he was now paſt taming, and able to ride and maſter the firſt Beaſt that ſet him up.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas the <hi>Woman,</hi> verſe laſt, is ſaid to be the <hi>Great City,</hi> it is (as I ſuppoſe) rather lain down as a <hi>Mark,</hi> or character to know the <hi>Woman</hi> by, and that from the place ſhe was to ſit in, then a deſcription of the <hi>Woman,</hi> which verſe 9. confirms me in, by giving us to underſtand that the woman ſits upon the ſeven Mountains (<hi>i.e.</hi> the City <hi>Rome</hi> anciently built upon ſeven Mountains) therefore the ſeven Mountains, <hi>i. e.</hi> the City <hi>Rome,</hi> is not, to ſpeak properly, the <hi>Woman,</hi> but the <hi>Seat of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What I have ſaid of the <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Woman,</hi> I may alſo ſay of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> ſpoken of in the words I am opening. The Beaſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56286:94"/>here is the Civil State, or the firſt Beaſt that ariſeth out of the <hi>Sea;</hi> the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or ſecond Beaſt, whoſe riſe is from the <hi>Earth.</hi> And indeed he that ſhall but parallel the ſecond Beaſt ſpoken of chap. 13. with what is ſpoken of the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> chap. 19. will find them to be one and the ſame; The falſe Prophet is a <hi>worker of Miracles,</hi> chap. 19.20. ſo is the ſecond Beaſt, chap. 13.17. The falſe Prophet by his miracles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Beaſts followers, chap. 19.20. ſo doth the ſecond Beaſt, chap. 13.14. The Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are helpful the one to the other, for the Beaſt defends the falſe Prophet by his ſtrength (for chap. 19.19. no force at all is mentioned that this <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> had at that great Randezvouze, who yet was preſonally preſent with the Beaſt, for he is taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, verſ. 20. therefore the Beaſt defends him) and the falſe Prophet by working miracles <hi>encourageth</hi> the Beaſt and his multitude, with hope of good ſucceſs, God is of their ſide. In like manner the two Beaſts, chap. 13. are (as before hath been ſhewed) <hi>helpful</hi> to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>The concluſion is, that by falſe Prophet we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſecond Beaſt ſpoken of chap. 13. and by Beaſt and falſe Prophet to underſtand the ſame here, as of the two Beaſts there, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State;</hi> onely with this difference, that Beaſt, which in his firſt riſe, was but a Beaſt; afterwards (when more grown) a <hi>Woman,</hi> riding upon, and over-topping the <hi>Civil</hi> power, or firſt Beaſt, which gave him his riſe, is now in his decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning condition a <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> where was his Magazine of Treaſure, together with the ſeizing and intercepting his <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Tributes</hi> by the Conqueror, hath ſo pulled down the Beaſt, ſo plucked the plumes of the Romiſh <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical State, i.e.</hi> brought the Pope and his Clergy to ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56286:94"/>low an ebb, that it is now but little that they can contribute either to the aſſiſtance of the firſt Beaſt, the Romiſh <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> power, or towards the upholding of their own ſinking Kingdom; yet becauſe having been a <hi>proud Whore,</hi> this Beaſt is loath to be of little repute, and to come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his firſt original of a poor earthly Beaſt yea would fain have the firſt Beaſt, the Civil power ſtill to dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and reckon him a conſiderable party, he will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem now to make up by his fained piety and devotion what is wanting in his former outward ſtrength and glory; and now he can be nothing elſe, he will needs be a <hi>Prophet</hi> to foretell good to his cauſe and Kingdom, though none he can do it; But obſerve, as when he was a Beaſt, he was an earthly Beaſt; as when a <hi>Woman,</hi> a <hi>Whore;</hi> ſo now, when a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> Though <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> may change ſhapes and formes, he can never make himſelf better than he is, but <hi>Antichriſt</hi> he will be, an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an <hi>Impoſter,</hi> a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> a <hi>Lyar</hi> ſtill.</p>
                        <p>Having thus ſeen the meaning of the words and names (which I have purpoſely inſiſted the larger upon, becauſe the right underſtanding hereof, doth (if I miſtake not) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the door into the very myſtery of this Book) I come to apply them to the buſineſs in hand, thus,</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> who from the beginning were Partners, going hand in hand and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring States together, ſeeing by the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>the City Rome</hi> ſuch a terrible ſhaking blow giving to their <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as that the next blow, if not prevented, is like unavoidably to be fatal, and to prove their utter ruin; they therefore now all of them <hi>convene in ſome General Councel,</hi> where they lay their heads together what thing is beſt for them to do to prevent another blow, or, if poſſible, to recover their own again. And upon debate <hi>two things</hi> being laid before them, as matter of deep and ſerious conſultation, <hi>viz. The late loſs they have received by the fall of Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56286:95"/>that by cauſing ſome of the Kings of the Earth, who were friends to their cauſe before, now for fear of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt the like ſhould befall themſelves, to with-draw, and ſtand a loof off.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>The great provocation ſince given to the Turk, by thoſe very Inſtruments their Enemies,</hi> which is like to make him joyn in with the utmoſt ſtrength hee can make (out of deſire to revenge himſelf, and recover his own again) to ruin (if it may bee) this growing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>vote</hi> or <hi>reſult</hi> of the meeting from the foregoing premiſes is, that (as the thing which doth moſt conduce to the upholding of their cauſe) <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi> of the fitteſt they can find for ſuch imployment, be ſpeeded away to ſuch Kings of the earth, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeem <hi>backward</hi> in the <hi>cauſe,</hi> to put life into them; and alſo to the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> to <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> him on to <hi>engage</hi> with them, in a <hi>quarrel</hi> that is <hi>his,</hi> as well as <hi>theirs;</hi> together with <hi>all others,</hi> of whom they have either <hi>hope</hi> that they will, or may be drawn to joyn with them; that by one <hi>general Randezvouze</hi> of all their force together, they may <hi>venture the whole,</hi> ſink, or ſwim, upon the <hi>event</hi> of one <hi>battel:</hi> Which battel is here called (for the remarkableneſs of it, both in regard of the multitude of enemies, and the glorious appearance of Chriſt with his Saints, who will fight this battel for them, in ſuch a way as never before) <hi>the battel of that great day of God Almighty:</hi> which is (I conceive) the <hi>ſame battel</hi> with what is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1, <hi>to</hi> 7: <hi>chap.</hi> 6.15. to the end, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.39. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Joel</hi> 3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. Of which <hi>terrible,</hi> yet <hi>glorious</hi> day, to mention all that in the foregoing Texts, and elſewhere is recorded of it, would call for a Treatiſe of it ſelf; and therefore I think it meet rather to leave the ſame to the ſober and pious meditations of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56286:95"/>than here to add any thing further upon ſo large a Subject.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> (who are ſaid to be <hi>three</hi> (though poſſibly they may be multitudes) becauſe a <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> number denotes perfection; and ſaid to come out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>falſe Prophet;</hi> not as if <hi>one</hi> came out of <hi>the mouth</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> another <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> and another <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>third;</hi> but becauſe their ſending is by the <hi>common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> of the aforeſaid <hi>three parties</hi>) who, or what they ſhall be, I look upon it as a part of curioſity to enquire any further into, then what is here by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That they ſhall be <hi>Spirits,</hi> viz. for their ſubtilty, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and activity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Unclean Spirits,</hi> for the filthineſs and impurity of their principles and converſation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Like <hi>Frogs,</hi> for their bold impudency, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al croaking in the ears of thoſe they are ſent to, giving them no reſt till they have drawn them forth to battel, withall creeping into every hole and corner of the world, to carry on their deſign.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 <hi>Spirits of Devils,</hi> for their diſſembling, lying, and cunning craft in deceiving, above all that ever were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed before them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 <hi>Working Miracles,</hi> and that (as it were) in way of imitation of the great and wonderful things God either hath done, or is then doing for his people; by this not onely to gain credit to their <hi>Ambaſſage,</hi> making the Kings <hi>of the Earth</hi> the more ready to receive it; but alſo to blind the eyes of thoſe they are ſent unto, and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> their hearts againſt the apparent works of God at this day, when they ſhall ſee things ſomewhat
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56286:96"/>like to what God is doing in the world, done by theſe: as the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> did blind <hi>Pharoah's</hi> eyes, harden his heart, by doing like things before him by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical art, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did by the finger of God.</p>
                        <p>And here I cannot but in the way take notice of that which is the ſpiritual Engine of the old <hi>Serpent,</hi> and one of his moſt politick Stratagems and Deviſes, to blind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the truths and diſpenſations of God in the world, making them very odious and to be loathed of many, which is, when he perceiveth that God hath any great Truth to make known, or any great Deſign to drive on in the World, which he cannot hinder, <hi>he will now become an Angel of light, and be of the foremoſt (by ſetting his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments about it) either in diſcovering this truth, or putting forward this deſign;</hi> that ſo, from a juſt cauſe of ſuſpition being laid, a prejudice being begotten in peoples hearts againſt theſe things, the things though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ever ſo clearly might find no acceptation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a general diſlike from thoſe that ſhould receive them; as at the time of Chriſts coming, <hi>he raiſed up falſe Chriſts</hi> as a blind, that the true might not be received. At the firſt preaching of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, <hi>he vaiſed up falſe Apoſtles.</hi> that the true might not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved; which is a thing hath been worthily obſerved by a godly man of late, and I here mention it onely by way of remembrance, that none of us may be taken in this crafty and hidden ſnare.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thus much of the firſt thing preparative to the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the ſeventh</hi> VIAL.</p>

                        <p>Verſe 15. <hi>BEhold I come as a Theef.</hi> That Chriſt ſhall <hi>perſonally appear</hi> before the laſt and General Judgement, is a thing that ſeems to me to have much footing both throughout the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> without granting of which, I my ſelf cannot as yet (poſſibly others may) <hi>reconcile</hi> one Scripture with another.</p>
                        <p>And truly, to take notice of this Opinion here, I am neceſſarily put upon it, unleſs I ſhould either wholly paſs over theſe words, or be falſe to my own perſwaſions, and that which as yet I cannot think otherwiſe, is the main thing intended by the Holy Ghoſt in them.</p>
                        <p>Though yet as the Argument it ſelf in this place doth more concern <hi>the time</hi> of <hi>his coming</hi> (viz. that <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſhall be betwixt the <hi>ſixt</hi> and <hi>ſeventh Vials</hi>) than <hi>the coming</hi> it ſelfe.

                        </p>

                        <p n="1">1 ARGUMENT, <hi>Chriſt ſhall perſonally appear at the time in which the remarkable battel of</hi> Armageddon <hi>ſhall be fought.</hi> But that ſhall be about this time.</p>

Now whilſt the <hi>Ancient</hi> of <hi>dayes</hi> is amongſt his people ſitting and judging the Beaſt, one comes to him <hi>like the Son of man with the clouds of Heaven to whom is given a Dominion, Glory, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Obſerve, firſt, He comes not to receive a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a <hi>ſpiritual way</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> but as the <hi>Son of man.</hi> Secondly, He comes with the <hi>clouds of Heaven,</hi> the very phraſe uſed to ſet forth his <hi>perſonal coming,</hi> Mat. 24.30. <hi>They ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory,</hi> Chap. 26.64. <hi>Hereafter ſhall yee ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> Rev. 1.7. <hi>behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He comes to the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> (who according to his God-head is the Ancient of dayes) that is, the <hi>Father,</hi> who now had ſet up his Throne on earth, and (as the Great Judge) was in the midſt of his people, manifeſting his Almighty power amongſt them in judging the Beaſt, and there receives his Kingdome, where the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> had now ſet up his Throne, was ſitting and judging. And this is a manifeſt Argument, that although his <hi>coming</hi> is mentioned after the caſting of the Beaſt into the burning flame, yet that indeed the ſame
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56286:98"/>muſt be before, becauſe he comes to the <hi>Ancient of dayes, i.e.</hi> the Father, whilſt hee was ſitting upon the Throne in the midſt of his people, and paſſing ſentence againſt the Beaſt, before the Beaſt is ſlain, his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and given to the burning flame, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding act, and the breaking up of the judgement, after which the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> ſits no longer: Therefore, I ſay, his <hi>coming</hi> muſt of neceſſity be before the <hi>utter everthrow</hi> of the Beaſt or fourth Monarchy, and within the time that the Father by his preſence and power amongſt his people is judging of the Beaſt.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, if we do but compare this ſeventh of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> with the 110. <hi>Pſal.</hi> (which is alſo a Prophecie of Chriſts Kingdome) we ſhall find them moſt excellently anſwering one to another, and the one helping to open the other. In verſ. 1. the Father ſaith to the Son, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi> What then? Why, the <hi>Father</hi> as the <hi>Ancient of dayes,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judged Chriſts enemies, and brought them well under, we have ſtreightway, verſ. 2 Chriſts <hi>coming. The Lord ſhall ſend the Rod of thy ſtrength out of Sion.</hi> And what doth Chriſt do at his <hi>coming?</hi> Why, as upon his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he finds the Beaſt, Antichriſt, here called the Head over many Countries (becauſe this Whore ſits upon many waters) and the Kings of the earth with their Armies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together to oppoſe him; ſo preſently he in his fury falls upon them, and deſtroyes them. Verſ. 5. <hi>The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath.</hi> The battel of <hi>Armageddon</hi> is called, <hi>That great day of God Almighty,</hi> Rev. 16.14. upon the founding of the ſeyenth Angel, the time of wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Thy wrath is come;</hi> here <hi>the day of wrath.</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>He ſhall judge among the heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the Head over many Countries;</hi> agreeing to that of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                           <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56286:99"/>of <hi>ſlaying</hi> the Beaſt, deſtroying his body, caſting it into the <hi>burning flame;</hi> and that <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. (where the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Armageddon</hi> is deſcribed) of deſtroying Kings and Captains, Verſ. 18. caſting the Beaſt into the <hi>lake of fire ſlaying the</hi> remnant, Verſ. 20, 21.</p>
                        <p>This appears yet farther, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. <hi>There ſhall bee a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation even to that ſame time, and at that time ſhall thy people be delivered.</hi> The concurrence of this <hi>day of trouble,</hi> and the battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> both with the time of the delivery of <hi>Daniels</hi> people (or the <hi>Jews</hi>) proves them to be one and the ſame. Now that a <hi>coming</hi> there is here, is clear, <hi>At that time ſhall Michael ſtand up,</hi> which that it is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> will appear, by comparing with <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where all acknowledge his <hi>Perſonal coming</hi> is ſpoken of, which yet is the ſame with this: for Chriſt ſpeaking of the time of it, quotes this of <hi>Daniel,</hi> verſ. 21, 22. <hi>Then ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This <hi>coming</hi> therefore muſt be that in the Text, <hi>I come as a Theef,</hi> both agreeing in time; and this being <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> that muſt alſo, The like to this we have with much clearneſs, verſ. 21, 22, 23.</p>

                        <p>One place more, and I conclude this Argument, and that is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19 20, 21. which that it is the ſame with the <hi>battel</hi> of <hi>Armageddon</hi> appears,</p>

The minor Propoſition I have proved before, in ſhewing that the <hi>coming</hi> in of the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt of neceſſity be betwixt the ſixt and ſeventh Vials. The major, That Chriſt at this time ſhall appear, I prove,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 From that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews converſion,</hi> mentions a coming of Chriſt, <hi>The deliverer ſhalcome out of Sion.</hi> Which words are to be taken in a <hi>litteral</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſence both, (as are many Scriptures elſe) as appears from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. whence they are quoted, where to evidence the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſence of them, the Prophet ſaith expreſly in the next verſe, <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor but of the mouth of thy ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> noting, that as their <hi>ſins</hi> ſhall be pardoned, ſo alſo more of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhall be given forth upon the <hi>Jews converſion</hi> than ever formerly (which more fully we have, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.) and this is the <hi>coming of the Deliverer</hi> to them in the <hi>spiritual</hi> ſence. Yet that beſides this there is <hi>a litteral coming</hi> in theſe words, appears, if you compare the foregoing verſes 16, 17, 18. (upon which theſe have a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56286:101"/>dependance) with the very ſame expreſſions almoſt, only a little more full, <hi>chap.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. where alſo (as here) mention is made of a <hi>coming.</hi> Ver. 1. <hi>Who is this that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Edom?</hi> which cannot be a <hi>spiritual coming, i.e.</hi> a deſtroying of his Enemies by a glorious manifeſtation of himſelf, and his power, with, and amongſt his people, becauſe then the doing of the work ſhould be by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereas Chriſts arm alone, without any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth this work, as verſe 3. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>I looked, and there was none to help, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that there was none to uphold; therefore my own Arm brought ſalvation to me, and my fury it upheld me.</hi> Neither could the litteral meaning of the words have their fulfilling in his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> in which he was not <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> in his apparrel, but without <hi>form</hi> and <hi>comelineſs, Chap.</hi> 53.2. neither was that a day of <hi>vengeance</hi> to tread down the people in anger, as this is Verſ. 4, 6.

                        <p n="3">3 This appears farther <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. from the Queſtion propounded to Chriſt by his Diſciples, <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> In which Queſtion three things are taken for granted by the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts; As, 1.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56286:102"/>queſtion, which includes the ſubſtance of what is pleaded for, <hi>viz. That the Kingdom ſhould be reſtored to Iſrael, and that by Chriſts perſonal appearance,</hi> are neither of them denied by Chriſt, who undoubtedly had their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion been grounded upon a miſtake, would, yea, it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to have ſhewn them their error, only their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of a Kingdom at preſent, whilſt he had other work for them to do firſt, is the thing reproved. Nay let me ſay, Chriſt doth in a manner affirm, all their ſuppoſitions, in ſaying, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>true, Iſrael</hi> ſhall have a Kingdom reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I am to do it, and that as you now conceive <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> appearing; onely it is <hi>not for you</hi> at preſent to <hi>know</hi> the time.</p>
                        <p>And this will more clearly appear if we carry theſe words to <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. where we have that ſet forth by the word <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> which here is called a <hi>Reſtoring. Whom the Heavens muſt receive untill the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began;</hi> yet with this difference, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. ſpeaks of the Kingdom in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, who ſhall be chief in it, Mich. 4.8. <hi>Thou, O Tower of the Flock, the ſtrong hold of the Daughter of Sion, unto thee ſhall it come, even the firſt Dominion, the Kingdom ſhall come to the Daughter of Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Acts</hi> 3. in reference to the <hi>whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which in the day the Kingdom ſhall be reſtored to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſhall alſo have a <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> which is expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
                        <p>Now in theſe words we have a <hi>coming</hi> clearly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>he ſhall ſend Jeſus which before was preached unto you, whom the Heavens muſt receive;</hi> Which that it is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and not <hi>Spiritual</hi> onely, is clear, becauſe ſuch as the <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt in the Heavens at the time when theſe things were ſpokrn, was, and hath been ſince, ſuch
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56286:103"/>ſhall his <hi>coming</hi> at this day be; but the <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt in the Heavens then, and ſince, cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a <hi>spiritual</hi> way, becauſe in that ſenſe he had ſaid before, <hi>Lo I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> Mat. 28.20. but muſt be in reſpect of his <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> preſence; therefore ſuch ſhall his <hi>preſence</hi> (Verſe 19.) be with his people at this time, <hi>viz Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Corporal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that this <hi>time</hi> of <hi>the reſtitution of all things</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>General Judgement</hi> (which hath been the common opinion) I cannot incline to, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe I find not the General Judgement ſpoken of in the plural number, as <hi>times, daies,</hi> as this is; <hi>the times of refreſhing,</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>times of reſtitution,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>theſe daies,</hi> verſ. 24.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56286:105"/>Behold thy King cometh unto thee, he is juſt, and having ſalvation, lowly, and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a Colt the foal of an Aſſe. And I will cut off the Chariot from Ephraim, and the horſe from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the battel bow ſhall be cut off, and he ſhall ſpeak peace unto the heathen, and his Dominion ſhall bee from Sea even to Sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</hi> Which latter words are an evidence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is yet to be fulfilled; and this <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt as a <hi>King,</hi> is the ſame, which (as under a type) was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Chriſts riding into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 21.4, 5. and that was in a <hi>Perſonal</hi> way.</p>
                        <p>There is but one Prophet more, and that is <hi>Malachy,</hi> who alſo ſpeaks of this, Chap. 3.2. <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth? for he is like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers ſope,</hi> Chap. 4.1, 2 3. <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtuble; and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my Name, ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus I have lead you through all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming but a few Texts out of each (more eſpecially the <hi>Pſalms, Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Zechary,</hi> which every where are full of this) inſtead of many that might be, ſhewing you what a <hi>harmony</hi> there is amongſt them all, as to the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Kingdome;</hi> which if any one can ſhew ſo full a <hi>harmony</hi> as to that of the <hi>General Judgement,</hi> I ſhall for time to come lay by this Scripture, as not of weight to prove the thing in hand; but till this is done, I ſhall hold my own concluſion, <hi>viz. That the time of the Reſtitution of all things, when Chriſt is Perſonally to appear, being that which all the Prophets have ſpoken of, is not the General Judgement,</hi> (which few or none
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56286:105"/>have ſpoken of) <hi>but the time of reſtoring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael,</hi> that being the thing that all the Prophets are full of, having treated of no one Subject more, nay not half ſo much.</p>
                        <p>And indeed the 20. verſe ſuits this Interpretation well, <hi>And he ſhall ſend Jeſus which before was preached unto you;</hi> the latter words <hi>unto you,</hi> having reference as well to <hi>ſending</hi> as <hi>preaching,</hi> and the meaning is, <hi>That Chriſt ſhall at this time as verily be ſent of the Father to the Jews, as then he was preached to them by Peter,</hi> and therefore <hi>Tremelius</hi> in his Tranſlation out of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> reads the <hi>(Vobis) to you,</hi> twice, after either Verb.</p>
                        <p>The Argument then lyes thus, <hi>If that Chriſt ſhall perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally appear at the time of the Kingdoms reſtoring to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (as hath been at large proved) <hi>and if this ſhal be in the Interval of time betwixt the ſixth and ſeventh Vials,</hi> (as alſo hath been formerly proved) <hi>then doth it follow, that Chriſts perſonal appearance or coming ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſixth and ſeventh Vials; and ſo is the very coming here ſpoken of:</hi> Behold I come as a Thief.</p>
                        <p>Two Arguments more to prove our Poſition, are in the words themſelves, which are,</p>
                        <p n="3">3 ARGUMENT. <hi>The phraſe of coming as a Thief, is moſt frequently uſed in Scripture to expreſs Chriſts perſonal coming,</hi> which therefore is the <hi>coming</hi> here intended, 1 Theſſ. 5.2. <hi>For your ſelves know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a Thief in the night.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10. <hi>But the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noyſe.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.42, 43, 44. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12 39, 40.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 ARGUMENT. <hi>The duty here ſpoken of, to which a ſpecial bleſſing is annexed, is that very duty which beleevers are with much earneſtneſs exhorted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56286:106"/>unto, whenſoever Chriſts perſonal coming is ſpoken of,</hi> Mat. 24.42. <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come,</hi> Chap. 25.13. So <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2. compared with 6. all which places ſpeak of no other <hi>coming</hi> but his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea the <hi>bleſſing</hi> annexed to this <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> we do not read of but thrice more in all the Scripture, and that is ever in ſuch places where mention is made of his <hi>perſonal coming,</hi> Luke 12.37, 38. we have the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing twice pronounced, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord when he cometh, ſhall find watching. And if he come in the ſecond watch, or in the third watch, and find them ſo, bleſſed are thoſe ſervants,</hi> Mat. 14.46. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom the Lord when hee cometh ſhall finde ſo doing;</hi> what <hi>doing?</hi> why, <hi>watching,</hi> and being <hi>ready againſt his coming,</hi> as verſ. 42.44.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two laſt Arguments taken from the words, I muſt confeſs, do not of themſelves conclude the thing, becauſe the ſame expreſſion of <hi>coming as a Thief,</hi> with the duty of <hi>watching</hi> annexed thereto, I find once uſed in a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> ſenſe, and that in Chriſts admonition to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Chap. 3.2, 3. Yet conſidering that is but once, and the other ſenſe frequent, there is hardly room left (could nothing elſe be ſaid) for an indifferency in the the thing, whether the coming here be <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> ſo as that we may take or leave; but now, when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with theſe the weight of the foregoing Arguments and Scriptures ſhall be put in the <hi>ballance,</hi> it will then appear that there is not only a <hi>probability,</hi> but a <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrength</hi> in theſe alſo.</p>
                        <p>Before I leave the thing, I ſhall adde yet further two <hi>Arguments</hi> more, tending not ſo much to prove the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ceming</hi> of Chriſt to be here meant, as in the <hi>general</hi> that the ſame is very neer, and therefore
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56286:106"/>moſt likely to be the coming here ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>That the man of ſin is to be conſumed with the breath of his mouth, and deſtroyed with the brightneſs of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which <hi>coming,</hi> can be no other than his <hi>Perſonal coming;</hi> becauſe it was that <hi>coming</hi> the Apoſtle had been ſpeaking of Verſ. 1, 2. about which the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were <hi>ſhaken in mind, and troubled,</hi> as conceiving it to be at hand (poſſibly from what the Apoſtle had written in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 4.15, 16, 17. (whence it might be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as if that preſent Generation ſhould live to ſee that day) and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Not by word, nor letter as from us,</hi> Verſe 1.) which <hi>trouble</hi> the Apoſtle endeavors to remove, by telling them that the <hi>man of Sin who was to be deſtroyed with the brightneſs of this coming was not as yet revealed,</hi> and that therefore this <hi>coming,</hi> which they were in doubt about, could not be ſudden.</p>

                        <p>And truly to me it is a Riddle how any of thoſe worthy men (which are not a few) who yet ſtrongly affirm the pouring out of the ſeventh Vial to be the laſt and General Judgement, can from their own Principle conclude any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that the <hi>coming</hi> of our Text (which is the immediate antecedent of the ſeventh Vial) is, yea, muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Perſonal coming,</hi>

                        <p>I anſwer, If <hi>[reſt of the dead]</hi> exclude any of the Saints from the firſt Reſurrection, then doth it include them in the ſecond Death, for the promiſe of being freed from the ſecond Death runs to thoſe only who have part in the firſt Reſurrection, verſ. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is hee that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond Death hath no power;</hi> therefore (I take it) that the <hi>Dead</hi> here oppoſed to the <hi>Living,</hi> are the wicked <hi>dead</hi> to the godly <hi>living,</hi> whoſe Reſurrection is not to be till the General Judgement, verſ. 13. who as they ſhall then ariſe to be <hi>judged,</hi> ſo being judged they are ſtreightway ſent to Hell; for as <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> deliver up their dead, verſ. 13. ſo <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe Death and Hell delivers up) are caſt into the <hi>lake of fire,</hi> verſ. 14. and as the firſt Reſurrection hath this golden Note ſet upon it, <hi>Bleſſed and holy is hee that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death ſhall have no power;</hi> So the ſecond this black mark, <hi>This is the ſecond Death,</hi> verſ. 14.</p>
                        <p>Now the reaſon why <hi>ſuffering Saints</hi> are principally mentioned in the firſt, I take to be this, becauſe this Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> being a doleful Tragedy, in the greateſt part of which we have little acted, but the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56286:111"/>of the Saints; Chriſt therefore to ſweeten this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup at the bottome, and conclude this Tragedy (as I may ſo ſay) with a glorious Comedy, ſpeaks of thoſe chiefly now (though not excluding others) as reigning with him, who throughout the book before, had been ſpoken of as ſuffering for him.</p>
                        <p>As to thoſe Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. with other ſuch like, which may ſeem to favour this opinion, I onely ſay, that heither thoſe, nor any other that hitherto I have met with, do poſitively exclude any Saints from that glory the Martyrs ſhall have in Chriſts Kingdome, though true it is, ſome Texts (where the Argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon is <hi>ſuffering</hi>) ſpecifie (not to exclude others, but for the comfort of the Sufferers) Martyrs or Sufferers only.</p>
                        <p>Yet if the Queſtion be ſtated thus, whether Martyrs or Sufferers, ſhall not have a greater degree of glory in this Kingdome, than many others; I ſhall not oppoſe it: For as I conceive the <hi>degrees of glory</hi> intimated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.40, 41. (which place (as I have ſhewed) ſpeaks of the firſt Reſurrection) are more proper to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to this time than to heaven hereafter, when God ſhall be all in all: So do I conceive that the more any man here hath laid out himſelf, either in a way of doing, or ſuffering for Chriſt, the greater glory and honour ſhall be put upon him at this day; which as it is incouragement now to do for Chriſt, ſo doth it give yet a farther anſwer, and that which I conceive may reconcile the difference) to ſuch Scriptures, as ſeem to intitle Martyrs only to the glory of this day.</p>
                        <p>Now taking this <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt (as hath been laid down) for that <hi>ſecond coming</hi> we all wait for, I ſee as yet no inconvenience following upon it, in caſe we ſay, that Chriſts <hi>ſecond coming</hi> ſhall be at this time, betwixt the pouring out of the ſixth and ſeventh Vials; and what
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56286:111"/>things are to be done in the world afterwards, are ſuch things only as Chriſt will diſpatch betwixt his coming, and the time of the end. And thus to conceive of Chriſts <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> as it no wayes tends to looſneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the neerneſs of this day calls aloud upon all to <hi>watch;</hi> yea may cauſe all thoſe who have hope in a day of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> to <hi>lift up their heads with joy,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Redemption draweth nigh;</hi> ſo doth it ſeem more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the current of Scriptures, and alſo to that which but a few years ago, was the faith of Gods people in general, to wit, that <hi>Chriſts ſecond coming</hi> could not bee far off, than the contrary opinion doth, which makes this coming, not to be till the General Judgement, which cannot be ſo little as a thouſand yeers off.</p>
                        <p>And truly when I conſider how godly Miniſters and people not many years paſt, did provoke one another from Chriſts <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> and harp upon it as near; and how at preſent few ſpeak of that, but look at <hi>comings</hi> of another kind, ſetting the <hi>ſecond coming</hi> a great way off; It is ſo far from bringing me into a beleef with them, as that contrariwiſe it nouriſheth within me a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion more ſtrongly, that his <hi>ſecond coming</hi> is at hand, and he will be upon us <hi>unawares,</hi> becauſe the Scripture tells us this day ſhall come as a <hi>ſnare</hi> upon all, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.35. <hi>And the Son of man at his coming ſhall hardly find faith</hi> (to beleeve his <hi>coming</hi> is ſo near) <hi>on the earth,</hi> Luke 18.8. Yea <hi>he comes at midnight,</hi> Matth. 25.6. an hour when but few are looking for their friend, and the calling upon beleevers ſo frequently to <hi>watch</hi> whenſoever Chriſts <hi>ſecond coming</hi> is ſpoken of, leſt that day come upon them unawares, and overtaken them as a Thief in the night, implies no leſs to me, than that which experience within theſe few years teacheth, that they (as well as others) will be apt to put the day of Chriſts <hi>coming</hi> far from them. And by how much I read over
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56286:112"/>theſe Scriptures the oftner, by ſo much have I the leſs hope (knowing that not one jot or tittle of the word ſhall fall to the ground) of ſeeing many of thoſe (ſome I have hopes we may) who have deeply drunk in the perſwaſion of a <hi>ſpiritual coming</hi> and Kingdome only, to change their minds, and be of another perſwaſion.</p>
                        <p>Only with ſuch I leave to ponder upon, this caution, <hi>Take heed, leſt as the Jews by expecting a glorious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coming at firſt, when Chriſt was to come in a low and despiſed way, did then miſtake his firſt coming; So you, by cleaving to a Spiritual coming onely, with a denial of a Perſonal, ſhould now miſtake his ſecond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will only adde, That the <hi>Security</hi> the Scripture holds forth, which will be, not upon the world only, but many of <hi>Gods people</hi> alſo, as touching the <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt, about that time when he is to come, is to me an Argument that <hi>Chriſts coming</hi> (I mean the coming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the coming to Judgement) is to be at the beginning of the Thouſand Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and not (as moſt who acknowledge the Thouſand years to be yet to come) at the end of them; becauſe were the coming at the end, how could there be a <hi>ſecurity,</hi> eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Beleevers,</hi> who now could expect nothing elſe every day but his <hi>coming,</hi> who would not ſay when they ſhould ſee God and Magog again gathering together, <hi>now is the Lord coming?</hi> how then would this day come <hi>unawares</hi> as a <hi>Thief</hi> upon them, when they could now neither look for, nor expect any thing elſe? but at the beginning of the Thouſand years, when as their thoughts and expectations ſhall be high, and all running upon another <hi>coming,</hi> viz. <hi>a glorious ſpiritual appearance,</hi> but no thoughts of a <hi>Perſonal,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes upon them, and takes them <hi>unawares,</hi> whilſt they dreamed not of ſuch a <hi>coming,</hi> but were gazing after another.</p>

                        <p>What I have hitherto ſaid as touching the <hi>Coming</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> varies nothing from that common received Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among good men, which holds and maintains a <hi>ſecond comming</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Judgement, but only in this.</p>
                        <p>The common Principle is, that the <hi>General Judgment</hi> ſhall begin immediately upon <hi>Chriſts coming.</hi> On the contrary, I conceive the <hi>thouſand years</hi> mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. are to <hi>ſucceed</hi> firſt upon his <hi>coming,</hi> and after that the <hi>General Judgement,</hi> which is clear, becauſe as the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt for the Reaſons afore-mentioned precede the <hi>battel</hi> of <hi>Armageddon;</hi> ſo is it as evident that the <hi>thouſand years</hi> muſt follow it (taking their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from that <hi>battel</hi>) as an intervening time betwixt that, and the General Judgement.</p>
                        <p>Now that the <hi>Thouſand years</hi> (ſix times repeated in chap. 20.) is in all to be underſtood of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame period</hi> of time, and not (as ſome) of <hi>two diſtinct pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> of time, each containing a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> is clear,</p>

                        <p>Here is all the ground that ever I have met with for that opinion, which makes the <hi>thouſand years</hi> of <hi>Satans binding,</hi> and the <hi>Saints reign,</hi> to be already paſt, which being nothing elſe but a very lump of <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> I do therefore for the foregoing Reaſons conclude the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> to be yet to <hi>come,</hi> and to follow <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> (as they are in this Prophecie laid down) after the <hi>battel</hi> of <hi>Armageddon;</hi> and indeed to be the very ſame (only firſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56286:116"/>here hinted in brief, afterwards more largely handled, which is the way and manner of laying down things in this Book) with that <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> a deſcription whereof we have Chap. 21. Chap 22.1. to the 6, which that it cannot be meant of <hi>Heavenly glory</hi> as moſt have ſuppoſed, but muſt ſet forth a <hi>glorious ſtate of the Church</hi> here on earth, ſhall appear in our following Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>I have not hitherto ſaid (which yet may be worth the weighing, to ſee what may follow upon it) That thoſe who make the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> to be paſt, do alſo make the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts reign the treading underfoot the</hi> Holy City, <hi>and the Womans being in the Wilderneſs, and the Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in ſackcloath,</hi> the ſame in reſpect of <hi>time,</hi> with the <hi>Devils binding,</hi> and the <hi>Saints reigning,</hi> which two <hi>contraries</hi> how they will be made to agree, is a thing that lyes out of the reach of my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>From what hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe it will ſufficiently appear, that the <hi>firſt Scene</hi> that is like to be <hi>acted</hi> in the world upon the <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt, will not be the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>General Judgement,</hi> but ſomething elſe.</p>
                        <p>Yet do I not deny, but that in a <hi>large ſenſe</hi> the whole time from Chriſts <hi>coming,</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of all things, may be called a <hi>Day of Judgement</hi> (which therefore (according to ſome) is looked upon as one <hi>great day,</hi> conſiſting of two parts, as doth the natural day; Firſt, the Evening, or <hi>thouſand yeers;</hi> And ſecondly, the Morning, or <hi>General Judgement,</hi> admitting only theſe two <hi>differences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>laſt day,</hi> and that which ſhall be in the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>thouſand yeers.</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56286:117"/>great white Throne, and him that ſate upon it,</hi> which agrees to <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. <hi>He ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his glory.</hi> Yea the whole buſineſs of the day is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> the King <hi>alone</hi> acts; <hi>he ſhall ſay to them on his right hand, Come,</hi> verſ. 34. <hi>to them on his left hand, Depart,</hi> verſ. 41. And when the righteous, to exalt his grace the more, profeſs their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the King only replies in way of juſtification of them, verſ 40. and contrariwiſe, when the wicked juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the King <hi>only</hi> replies, ſhewing the equity of the ſentence paſſed upon them, verſ. 44, 45.</p>
                        <p>But now the <hi>judgement</hi> of ſinners upon Chriſts <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming</hi> in the time of the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> untill the laſt day, ſhall be by Chriſt and his Saints together, and therefore of this time it is ſaid, Rev. 20.4. <hi>I ſaw Thrones,</hi> (in the plural number) <hi>and they ſate upon them, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given unto them,</hi> Iſa. 31.1. <hi>A King ſhall rule in righteouſneſs, and Princes ſhall rule in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and we may read, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>that at the time</hi> when Chriſt receives his Kingdome, the faithful ſervant who hath improved his ten Talents well, is then made ruler over ten Cities; hee that well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved five, over five Cities, expounding that, 1 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Do yee not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi>

                        <p>And what dangerous conſequences will follow hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe we ſay, that <hi>as Chriſt himſelf after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection continued ſome time on earth, doing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers work, before he entred into his reſt; ſo the Saints</hi> (that herein alſo they might be like him) <hi>ſhall after their reſurrection continue here on earth, doing the work of their Redeemer,</hi> (and that ſome time) <hi>before they enter into their reſt,</hi> doth not as yet appear to me.</p>

Now what if we ſhould ſay, that as when the old world was deſtroyed by water, not onely righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> and godly <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> but alſo curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> yea, the kinds of all the creatures were ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that deluge to repleniſh the new world; ſo at this day, not onely the Saints in the world ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but even ſome of the wicked, yea of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſerve the glorious ends and deſigns of God, and that in the <hi>new Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth?</hi> which ſeems not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ground, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22. <hi>That the creatures earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waits for that day,</hi> in which the Sons of God ſhall be manifeſt; when the creature (Devils and wicked men, on whom the curſe ſhall ſtill remain, excepted) ſhall be delivered from that bondage of corruption that now it groans under, and that not by a total diſſolution, or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56286:119"/>of it, but by a glorious reſtauration, bringing it into <hi>the liberty of the Sons of God. For the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Sons of God; becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</hi> And alſo becauſe in thoſe very <hi>new Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> that <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaks of, and <hi>Peter</hi> quotes from him, <hi>the Wolfe and the Lamb ſhall feed together;</hi> that is, good and bad ſhall be in the world together.</p>
                        <p>Neither let it be ſaid that this will be any <hi>hinderance</hi> to the <hi>Saints glory</hi> and <hi>ſpirituality,</hi> to bring them from Heaven, the place of glory, and that about a work ſo mean, and low, to rule over men upon earth; for as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> loſe not their <hi>glory</hi> by <hi>attending</hi> upon the work of God here on earth, nor their <hi>spirituliaty,</hi> becauſe the works they attend upon, of miniſtring to the Saints, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Enemies of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in themſelves mean and low, yea, in a manner ſervile for ſo glorious Creatures as <hi>Angels</hi> to attend upon; ſo ſhall not <hi>Saints</hi> at this day, by being occupied in the Affairs of this <hi>Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> (which ſhall be their work for Chriſt, to act as Officers under him in his Kingdom) <hi>loſe</hi> any thing of their <hi>glory,</hi> eſpecially conſidering Chriſt himſelf (whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is their glory) ſhall be with them all this time; nor of their <hi>Spirituality,</hi> which never ſuffers decay in any, through a being occupied in the will and work of the Lord. And what if the Lord, who in the Legal Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thought it good to have his peoples work a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in the Goſpel Adminiſtration, work, but no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; will in this adminiſtration have work and glory go together, who will, or hath cauſe to find fault with it? Nay, let me ſay (what ſometimes hath been in my thought with refreſhing) that the <hi>ſpirituality of Saints</hi> at this day ſhall be ſuch, as that from thence an awe ſhall be upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56286:120"/>the world, who now <hi>tremble</hi> before them.</p>
                        <p>By what hath been before ſaid, it may appear, that notwithſtanding the <hi>thouſand years</hi> is a <hi>diſtinct</hi> time from the Day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> being that <hi>time,</hi> to ſpeak properly, in which <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall <hi>judge</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>reign</hi> on the earth; yet in a large ſenſe the time of the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> and the <hi>General Judgement</hi> both, may bee called <hi>one great Day</hi> of <hi>Judgement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed that <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall one day <hi>judge the world,</hi> is a thing ſo clear in Scripture, that good men not making a <hi>diſtinction</hi> betwixt the <hi>judging</hi> in the time of the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> and the <hi>General Judgement,</hi> do bring the Saints at the laſt day, inſtead of ſtanding upon Chriſts right hand, even to fit with him upon the Bench, and then, and there to judge the world, which opinion is not only repugnant to thoſe other Scriptures wherein we have the manner of <hi>Saints reigning</hi> over, and <hi>judging</hi> the world, ſet forth, which without a manifeſt forcing of them cannot be applied to this time; but alſo hath not the leaſt countenance for it ſelf from any one Scripture (that I know of) where expreſs mention is made of the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>General Judgement,</hi> but the contrary rather, as from that I have ſaid before, may bee gathered) which is enough to put us upon a further ſearch, and not to receive this principle upon truſt any longer.</p>
                        <p>And truly to me it appears, that the Apoſtle himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23, 24, 25. makes a manifeſt <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two <hi>times</hi> of <hi>judging,</hi> calling one the <hi>time of Chriſts Reign,</hi> to put his enemies under his feet; the other the <hi>time of the end,</hi> and both theſe after his <hi>coming; Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming. Then cometh the end</hi> (plainly intimating a <hi>diſtance</hi> of <hi>time</hi> betwixt his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>the end</hi>) <hi>when he ſhall have delivered up the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56286:120"/>Kingdome to God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all Rule and Authority, and Bower: For hee, muſt Reign</hi> (ſhewing what his work ſhall be betwixt the <hi>time</hi> of his <hi>coming,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi>) <hi>till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Why both theſe <hi>different judgings</hi> may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdome;</hi> the <hi>quick</hi> firſt in ſuch manner as hath been ſhewed, and then the <hi>dead</hi> at the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>General Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which both are called his Appearing and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe he is but once to appear to do both, and both taken together, do but make up this Kingdome of Chriſt, in which as King of Kings, Chriſt will glorifie himſelf in the eyes of all creatures) I ſee no convincing reaſon to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Having thus ſpoken of the coming of our Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that light I have received from the word; I only now deſire, that none of Gods people who ſhall read this, may be of the number of thoſe who are troubled <hi>in mind, and ſhaken that the day of the Lord is at hand;</hi> but rather of thoſe who patiently wait for the <hi>coming</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and love his <hi>appearing,</hi> whoſe hearts till the riſe of this <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>morning ſtar</hi> will not ceaſe, but with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Bride,</hi> ſend forth their continual groans and eryes, <hi>Come, O come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 RULE, <hi>That the divers expreſsions in Scripture concerning the coming of Chriſt, which ſet him forth as coming in various Dreſſes,</hi> ſomtime as a <hi>Bridgroom,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in <hi>fire,</hi> ſometimes as a <hi>Warrior,</hi> as a <hi>Judge, are not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56286:121"/>to be underſtood of divers comings, but one and the ſame coming in divers reſpects;</hi> as when his <hi>coming</hi> is ſpoken of in <hi>reſpect</hi> of his Saints, he comes as a <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> when in <hi>reſpect</hi> of the wicked, in <hi>flaming fire;</hi> when in reſpect of the <hi>deſtruction</hi> he will make of thoſe enemies he finds ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at his <hi>coming,</hi> he appears as a <hi>Warrior,</hi> with a <hi>Sword, Armies</hi> following him, <hi>Garments rolled in blood;</hi> when in reſpect of that <hi>diſtinction,</hi> he will make at this day betwixt the clean and unclean, <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> true worſhippers, and falſe, or the <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> he would make even of his own people, he comes then as a <hi>Refiners fire,</hi> to refine and ſeparate the true gold from the droſs; when in <hi>reſpect</hi> of the <hi>principal work</hi> he comes about, namely to execute judgement, he comes then as a <hi>Judge:</hi> Thus ever appearing in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Dreſſes, either as the perſons he <hi>comes</hi> to, or the works he is to perform upon his <hi>coming,</hi> are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 RULE, <hi>As there is a Spiritual coming of Chriſt, as well as a Perſonal; ſo in ſome places which ſpeak of this coming, both theſe are included,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſhewed in opening <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 RULE, <hi>As the Perſonal coming of Chriſt is twofold,</hi> Firſt, a <hi>coming</hi> to bear our ſins; Secondly, a <hi>coming</hi> without ſin to ſalvation: <hi>So in ſome places which ſpeaks of Chriſts coming, both theſe are couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or at leaſt wiſe joyned ſo near one to another as that they ſeem to be one and the ſame.</hi> So <hi>Gen</hi> 49.10. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil Shiloh (i.e.</hi> Chriſt the Meſſias) <hi>come,</hi> which in reſpect of the former words, The <hi>Scepter departing from Judah,</hi> hath <hi>reference</hi> to his <hi>firſt coming;</hi> but in reſpect of the latter, the <hi>gathering of the people</hi> to him, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him ſhall the gathering of the people be (i.e. Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhall be gathered together under him as Head or King over them) ſo it <hi>refers</hi> to his <hi>ſecond
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56286:121"/>coming.</hi> So <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.2. the <hi>coming</hi> verſ. 1. is his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> as a Harbinger <hi>comes</hi> before him; but verſ. 2. (that we may take notice what myſtery is in Scripture) the Holy Ghoſt glides from his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> to his <hi>ſecond,</hi> which in ſo terrible, as that who now <hi>may abide the day of his coming?</hi> or ſtand when he appeareth? So <hi>Zach.</hi> Chap. 13.7. ſpeaks of his <hi>firſt coming, Awake, O Sword, againſt the man that is my fellow, ſmite the Shepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered;</hi> but preſently, Chap. 14.3 4, 5. we have his <hi>ſecond.</hi> So <hi>Mic.</hi> 5 1. we have his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> in which the Judge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſmitten upon the cheek; and the <hi>Jews</hi> thereupon being for this given up, and rejected for a time, as verſ. 3. we have preſently his <hi>ſecond coming</hi> ſpoken of, verſ 4.5. both <hi>comings</hi> being brought in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in one breath.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of the ſecond thing, <hi>The Perſonal coming, and appearing of Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56286:122"/>be <hi>watchful;</hi> and as before I have ſpoken of the one, to wit, <hi>Chriſts coming,</hi> ſo may I not here leap over the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>duty of watching,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt having joyned them together.</p>
                        <p>Yet for ſo much as concerns the <hi>practical</hi> part of this duty, that being a thing more commonly known (though not practiſed as known) and alſo not ſo proper to the buſineſs I am now upon, being only expoſition, I ſhall wave it, chuſing to inſiſt upon (as a thing more proper to our work, and which alſo may be of uſe to ſtir up thoſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know the duty, to ſtand <hi>SHALL I? SHALL I?</hi> no longer, but in good earneſt to apply themſelves to it) the reaſons why the Holy Ghoſt hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>watching,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts coming,</hi> as that it is a thing rare to read of the one, and not alſo to hear of the other.</p>
                        <p>Now in the 24. and 25. Chapters of <hi>Matthew</hi> (the moſt full, and pathetical Sermon that ever our Lord preached of his coming) we have ſeveral things foretold by Chriſt himſelf, the which too evidently would appear about the time of his <hi>coming,</hi> which are the principal <hi>reaſons</hi> why Chriſt ſo calls upon his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and in them all <hi>Beleevers,</hi> as <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.37. <hi>What I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch;</hi> And therefore thoſe more eſpecially which ſhould live <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>about the time</hi> wherein theſe things were to have their accompliſhment, to bee <hi>watchful,</hi> Chap. 24.42. Chap. 25.13. which things by how much we ſee them more appearing, by ſo much may we conclude the <hi>ſecond coming</hi> of Chriſt is nearer, and ſtill have ſtrength added to our foregoing Poſition, that it is that <hi>coming,</hi> and no other, ſpoken of in the words, <hi>I come as a Thief.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now theſe are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>A ſtrange ſleep upon many Profeſſors.</hi> This is held forth in the Parable of the Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. verſ. 1.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56286:122"/>
                           <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdome of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> 2. <hi>And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> Which <hi>ſleep</hi> is not (as I conceive) a <hi>ſleep</hi> in reſpect of outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, for the <hi>ſleepers</hi> ſhall have a kind of Profeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs ſtill, as is intimated in that of the fooliſh Virgins to the wiſe, juſt upon the Bridegrooms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <hi>Our lamps are gone out,</hi> verſ. 8. arguing, that the <hi>Lamps,</hi> that is, the outward Profeſſion of wiſe and fooliſh, was held up, did not <hi>ceaſe</hi> burning, till the very <hi>moment</hi> of the Bridegrooms <hi>coming,</hi> though yet at the time he tarried, they are ſaid to be <hi>aſleep,</hi> verſ. 5. But it is a <hi>ſleep</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>practice,</hi> and exerciſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which many at this day, who had formerly been as well Practitioners as Profeſſors, ſhould now lay aſide, as a needleſs and ſuperfluous thing, and ſo become meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; vaniſhing altogether into <hi>aery</hi> notions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with a kind of <hi>diſdain</hi> and contempt of Chriſtian fife and converſation. Men that have been formerly much for <hi>Prayer,</hi> much for <hi>reading, hearing, Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſtrict, and holy walking,</hi> ſhall now look upon all theſe as <hi>low</hi> and <hi>childiſh</hi> things, ſpeaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, We are now expecting the Bridegroom, looking for the glorious appearance of the Morning-ſtar, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, great and high diſcoveries of God, and therefore away with theſe low camal duties, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, what ſhall we, who expect ſuch glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, exerciſe our ſelves in theſe mean and childiſh things? which indeed were fit for thoſe who lived under former diſpenſations, and more dark adminiſtrations, but do not become us upon whom the morning-ſtar is tiſen.</p>
                        <p>And here (if I may ſo ſay, though with ſubmiſſion to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56286:123"/>others) I conceive the thing I am ſpeaking of to bee the very <hi>ſleep</hi> before mentioned of the <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> for (as by the ſcope of the Parable appears) theſe were in the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven, i. e.</hi> Members of the viſible Church. Now the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> being a thing expected and looked for (though ſome look for it in one way, ſome in another) in the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven, i. e.</hi> by the Members of the viſible Church, as near at hand; theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> will needs hereupon preſently in all haſte be going forth, before the ſet time, to meet him, <hi>They went forth to meet the Bridegroom,</hi> verſ. 1. that is, (as I conceive) they reject all communion, holy duties, and Ordinances, &amp;c. (things once they did exerciſe in) as things now no longer in uſe, but out of date, and bidding farewel to theſe, go forth with high expectations of great and glorious things, at the appearance of the Bridegroom now at hand, as if they ſhould ſay, The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is <hi>coming,</hi> he is <hi>coming,</hi> whoſe appearance puts an end to all theſe things, and therefore why ſhall we any longer exerciſe our ſelves in them? away therefore with theſe Duties and Ordinances, it behoves us to go forth and meet the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> we will walk no longer in this way, but come, let us go forth to that higher, and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious adminiſtration, that the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> brings with him.</p>
                        <p>Now they going thus before the time, I ſay, and mark it well before the time, for afterwards, verſ. 6. we read of a <hi>command</hi> given at the <hi>Bridegrooms coming,</hi> to go <hi>forth</hi> and <hi>meet</hi> him; till which <hi>command</hi> had come had they ſtayed, and continued in that ſtation the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> left them in upon his departure, yeelding cheerful obedience to all thoſe his wayes and commands, which he bid them to mind, and be converſant in till his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> they had done well; but going out before the time, leaving the Laws of Chriſt, before Chriſt the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56286:123"/>had aboliſhed them, caſting off their former practice, and the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> not coming ſo ſoon as they expected, to direct them into a new, they <hi>ſlumber and ſleep, i.e.</hi> do even nothing at all; as a ſleepy man ſtirs not, acts not in any way or duty for Gods glory, or his Neighbours good; ſo it now fares with them, which ſo ſad an effect of their going forth to meet the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> hath made me to think, that although the thing it ſelf were very good, had they but waited till the coming forth of the Royal Edict, for the abrogation of the old Law, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new; yet for them to go forth to meet the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> before the time, to run before they were called, to abrogate Chriſts Laws, before himſelf had done it, was ſinful, and very evil, and that for which God, by way of correction of ſo great arrogancy and preſumption, gives them up to this <hi>spiritual ſlumber</hi> and <hi>ſleep</hi> here ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas I ſaid at firſt this <hi>ſleep</hi> ſhould be of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> I ſpake it to this end, that none might imagine this <hi>ſleep</hi> to be general upon all the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56286:124"/>ſome Servants improving their <hi>Talents,</hi> therefore not all <hi>ſleeping;</hi> and likewiſe, from verſ. 46. of the precedent Chapter, which tells us; that ſome at Chriſts coming ſhould be found doing their Maſters work; <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall finde ſo doing,</hi> therefore not all aſleep; Yet (I ſay) <hi>all</hi> takes in <hi>every</hi> of thoſe Virgins who <hi>went</hi> forth before the time <hi>to meet</hi> the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> the number of which ſhall not be a few; for they are not ſet forth by a ſmaller number, as two, but by a greater, as ten.</p>
                        <p>Two things here are very obſervable, which I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſeeming to intimate the way or manner how this <hi>ſleep</hi> ſhall creep on upon the Virgins at this day.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>From a falſe Principle commonly received among the Virgins, as touching the coming of Chriſt,</hi> namely, that the ſame ſhall be <hi>ſpiritual</hi> onely, and not <hi>perſonal;</hi> this to me appears from the <hi>attempt</hi> they make, and that before his <hi>coming,</hi> to go forth and meet him; for taking this for granted (which is indeed a certain truth) that the Adminiſtration that now is, is to be in force but <hi>till his coming,</hi> and they conceiving this <hi>coming</hi> of Chriſt to be no other, but a more <hi>glorious man feſtation of himſelf</hi> in a <hi>spiritual way</hi> to the ſouls of his people, judging withall, <hi>ſome beginnings</hi> of this to be already both in themſelves and others; they hence conclude the <hi>time</hi> now to be <hi>come</hi> in which theſe things are to ceaſe, the <hi>Day-ſtar</hi> (which will ſuddenly inlighten the whole world) beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Theſe things</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath foretold to be in the world a <hi>little</hi> before his <hi>coming,</hi> to eſcape which, as he there calls upon his Diſciples to <hi>Watch, watch, watch;</hi> ſo do I conceive for the very ſame <hi>reaſons,</hi> in the words I am upon, are we <hi>exhorted</hi> to this <hi>duty,</hi> becauſe, as by all theſe, ſanctification grows into decay, and they are made naked in the eyes of others to their ſhame, (as <hi>Aaron</hi> made <hi>Iſrael</hi> by that ſin of the Calf, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56286:126"/>their enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.25.) ſo the very motive to this duty of <hi>watching,</hi> in the words, is the <hi>keeping their Garments,</hi> that is, of Sanctification (the Garment of Juſtification being but one Garment, reſembled by the Robe Chriſt wore in the daies of his fleſh, which was one intire peece, without ſeam throughout, and that rather Chriſts put upon us, than ours, and not at all truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hands to keep, but kept in Chriſts for us, and therefore not that here ſpoken of) leſt by loſing of them they become <hi>naked,</hi> and are in the eyes of others, yea, their enemies (who can ſee theſe Garments, though a Saints Juſtification is a thing hidden from them) <hi>expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhame,</hi> which in a few words comprehends all thoſe reaſons Chriſt had laid down and preſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and 25. why beleevers living in times immediately preceding his coming, ſhould be watchful.</p>
                        <p>And let not any, in caſe what I have ſaid ſit too cloſe, be for that offended at the Author (who is a friend to all that love the Lord Jeſus) or ſleight the things themſelves, but rather conſidering what Chriſt hath plainly foretold ſhall be a little before his coming, let them learn this, to conſider their own ways, and lay ſeriouſly their practices to heart, leſt otherwiſe he come upon them as a Theef, before they ſhall have time to get oyl into their Lamps, or to put on again their Garments, which now they have put off.</p>

                        <p>Theſe words have relation to the 14. Verſe, where we have the Kings of the Earth, and the whole world gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to <hi>the battel of the great day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;</hi> onely becauſe whilſt they are gathering together from all parts, and now in a manner their whole body u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and ready to ſwallow up his people, Chriſt appears, and interpoſeth himſelf betwixt his people, and their bloody raging enemies, therefore we have the <hi>coming of Chriſt,</hi> Verſe 15. brought in between their gathering together, and their full and compleat Randezvouze; and ſo theſe words come to be diſ-joyned from the former.</p>
                        <p>As touching the <hi>place</hi> here called <hi>Armageddon,</hi> the opinions of Writers are various, which (being not a thing ſo material) I ſhall not recite; my own thoughts incline to their opinion, who read it <hi>the place of deſtruction of an Army;</hi> And poſſibly there may be an alluſion in the name, to that great deſtruction of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> at the waters of <hi>Megiddo, Judg.</hi> 5.19. when <hi>Siſera</hi> the chief Captain of <hi>Jabin,</hi> with all his Hoſt, fell by the hand of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> where was made ſuch a total <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it is ſaid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.16. <hi>And the Host of Siſera fell upon the edge of the ſword, and there was not a man left.</hi> And indeed, I the rather incline to this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the agreeableneſs of it, to thoſe other Scriptures, where (as before I have ſhewed) this battel is ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.6. <hi>I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury,</hi> Chap. 66.16. <hi>The
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56286:127"/>ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many, Joel chap.</hi> 3.14. calls it <hi>the valley of Deciſion,</hi> or cutting off; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.21. <hi>The remnant were ſlain with the ſword of him that ſate on the Horſe.</hi> All implying a great and marvellous deſtruction of enemies.</p>
                        <p>The meaning of the whole is, <hi>That Chriſt himſelf, as well as the spirits before mentioned,</hi> Verſ 13, 14. <hi>hath a special hand in the gathering together this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Troop;</hi> they to deſtroy the Saints and people of Chriſt, but he to manifeſt his love to his children, and his own glory the more upon his appearing, and to revenge upon them with his own hand the blood of his people; and although their coming up, and gathering to a head is through their inſtigation, yet the diſpoſing of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and place of Randezvouze is his, who gathers them together into the appointed place of their deſtruction, where for his peoples ſake, he intends to render upon them his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of fire, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth it.</p>
                        <p>And methinks, when my thoughts are fixed upon this day, I cannot but ſometimes ſtand and admire, not ſo much at the <hi>ruin</hi> of the enemies, as at that <hi>matchleſs love</hi> of Chriſt towards his, which will appear in doing of it, who ſeems at this day to act the holy paſſions of a provoked Father and Husband, who having ſeen his children oft murdered before his face, and his beloved Spouſe now in the hands of the Murderers, can no longer forbear, but in the heat and vehemency of affection, with unexpreſſible indignation, he himſelf with his drawn ſword ruſheth forth upon the Murderers, (as not contented to have their blood, if his own hands be not dipped in it) fighting with <hi>fury through</hi> and <hi>through,</hi> and from the <hi>rage</hi> of his mightily provoked ſpirit, being become deaf to all cryes, kils and ſlays without pity or mercy; and is ſo far from ſadly reſenting what he hath done after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56286:127"/>as that he is marvellouſly delighted, yea glories in it, that for the ſake of his Children and Spouſe (whoſe quarrel he hath been now revenging) he hath ingaged ſo far, as to come off the field with <hi>Garments dyed red</hi> in the blood of their enemies, which excellently we have ſet forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. where we have Chriſt after this wonderful ſlaughter made of his peoples enemies, and that with his own hand (who therefore is ſaid to <hi>come from Edom, Edom</hi> being ever a cruel enemy to <hi>Iſrael</hi>) turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in a way of triumph preſenting himſelf to his Spouſe, who ſeeing one coming, <hi>glorious in his apparrel</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> moſt delightful to behold) and yet withall having <hi>Garments dyed in blood, and travelling as a mighty Gyant in the greatneſs of his ſtrength,</hi> ſhe is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (as in an ex aſie, through wonderment, fear, and joy) ſhe cryes out, Who? <hi>Who is this that cometh from Edom in ſuch</hi> a manner, <hi>with dyed Garments? yet glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his apparrel, travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength:</hi> To whom Chriſt preſently replies, <hi>It is I,</hi> O my Spouſe, <hi>It is I,</hi> who am <hi>mighty to ſave thee,</hi> who for thy ſake have been <hi>treading the Winepreſs alone,</hi> trampling the <hi>people in mine anger,</hi> making them <hi>drunk in my fury,</hi> bringing down their ſtrength to the Earth; and it is ſo far from repenting me of any thing that for thee I have done, that were there, or ſhall there be any more to gather together againſt thee, I can yet do no leſs (for my heart is filled with vengeance) than tread them in mine anger, yea trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my Garments, and I will ſlain all my Rayment.</p>

(which is a clear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the glory, riches, duration, vaſt extent of this Kingdome, agreeing in many things with that glorious Propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.) is intituled, <hi>A Pſalm for Solomon;</hi> yet in <hi>reſpect</hi> of Chriſt, the King, or Monarch, in this Kingdome, <hi>David</hi> in Scripture is ever the <hi>Type,</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56286:130"/>not <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> after he was ſate upon the Throne, did foulely back-ſlide to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> did that which was <hi>right</hi> in the ſight of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>voyce</hi> coming from the <hi>Throne,</hi> intimates (what I have been ſpeaking) that <hi>now Chriſts Throne</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſet up,</hi> and himſelf <hi>ſit</hi> upon it, as Chap. 21.5. which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we have, Chap. 3.21. <hi>To him that overcommeth will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> The <hi>Throne</hi> Chriſt here ſpeaks of, is a <hi>diſtinct Throne</hi> from his <hi>Fathers Throne,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Throne</hi> as he <hi>was not</hi> to <hi>ſit</hi> on, till he ſhould come from his <hi>Fathers Throne;</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>the Throne</hi> I am upon at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is <hi>my Fathers Throne,</hi> which I, <hi>overcoming,</hi> am priviledged to <hi>ſit</hi> upon; but I have a <hi>Throne</hi> of my <hi>own,</hi> which I ſhall <hi>one day ſit</hi> upon, when he that <hi>overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> ſhall <hi>ſit</hi> down with me on this my <hi>Throne,</hi> as I now by <hi>overcoming</hi> am <hi>ſet</hi> down with my Father on his <hi>Throne;</hi> which as it proves Chriſt ſhall have a <hi>Throne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> from that on which he now <hi>ſits,</hi> ſo alſo, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what I ſaid even now, that the <hi>Dominion,</hi> or the <hi>Throne,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>given</hi> to <hi>the Saints,</hi> untill ſuch time as Chriſt himſelf <hi>comes</hi> and <hi>ſits</hi> him down upon his <hi>Throne,</hi> according to that <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> and it is for this reaſon, becauſe the Apoſtles ſhall be advanced as <hi>chief</hi> in this <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that Chap. 21.14. tells us that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of this City ſhall have in it, <hi>the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this <hi>Throne,</hi> becauſe not <hi>onely</hi> Chriſt himſelf <hi>ſits</hi> upon it, but alſo <hi>his Saints</hi> with him, is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56286:131"/>
                           <hi>Thrones</hi> in the plural number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and they ſate upon them, and judgement was given unto them;</hi> which words exactly agree for time (as before I have ſhewed) with this of the ſeventh <hi>Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now whereas this <hi>Throne</hi> upon which <hi>Chriſt ſits</hi> and utters his <hi>voyce,</hi> is ſaid to be in the <hi>Temple</hi> of Heaven, it clearly denotes (Heaven in the <hi>Revelation</hi> being always underſtood of the Church on Earth) the erecting of this <hi>Throne</hi> here below.</p>
                        <p>And indeed if we compare with Chap. 21. where we have the <hi>ſame Throne</hi> ſpoken of, together with the <hi>voyce</hi> from it, <hi>It is done,</hi> Verſe 5, 6. it will evidently appear that the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> there deſcribed, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a glorious ſtate of the Church here on earth, and not (as ſome) of Heaven hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>John</hi> ſees a <hi>New Earth</hi> as well as a <hi>New Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Becauſe the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is ſaid to come <hi>down from God out of Heaven,</hi> Verſe 2. therefore not a deſcription of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which coming down out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> left we ſhould imagine it (as ſome) to be <hi>Viſional</hi> onely; namely, that <hi>John</hi> in way of <hi>Viſion</hi> ſaw it come down, but really it is above; we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to free us from ſuch a miſtake) a <hi>great voyce</hi> added, Verſe 3. <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, i.e.</hi> on earth, the place of mens habitation, whereas were the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> to be underſtood of <hi>Heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the contrary ſhould be, <hi>viz. The Tabernacle of men with God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>glory</hi> of the Kings of the Earth (which glory is outward) and of the Nations, ſhall be brought into it, Verſe 24. <hi>The Kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it,</hi> Verſe 26. <hi>And they ſhall bring the glory and honor of the Nations, into it,</hi>
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:56286:131"/>Neither of which can agree to <hi>Heaven hereafter,</hi> but do moſt excellently agree to what is ſpoken at large in the Prophets of the <hi>glorious ſtate</hi> of the Church on <hi>Earth</hi> in <hi>the laſt daies.</hi> To ſay (as is commonly) ſuch of the Kings of the Earth, and thoſe of the Nations who ſhall be converted here, ſhall be there glorified; and this to be the bringing of the glory of the Kings and Nations thither.</p>
                        <p>To that I anſwer, 1. How can this be ſaid to be <hi>their glory,</hi> which is rather <hi>Gods</hi> put upon them, than theirs?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 How is this brought <hi>thither?</hi> is the glory of Heaven fetched thither from Earth?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 How can they be ſaid to <hi>bring it thither,</hi> who never receive this glory till they come there?</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Becauſe it is evident from the 12. and 14. Verſes, that the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> of the Lamb, ſhall be firſt or <hi>chief</hi> in this <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> but let it be proved from any other Scripture, that they ſhall be ſo in Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Becauſe Chap. 22. (which to Verſe 6. is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>) tells us, ver. 2. of a <hi>Tree</hi> in this <hi>New Jeruſalem, whoſe leaves are for the healing of the Nations.</hi> Now let it be ſhewn how the <hi>Nations</hi> ſhall bee <hi>healed</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Becauſe in this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention made, as of the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> ſo alſo of <hi>the Lamb,</hi> Chap. 22.1. <hi>proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb,</hi> Verſe 3. <hi>There ſhall be no more curſe, but the Throne of God, and of the Lamb ſhall be in it.</hi> But now in <hi>Heaven hereafter,</hi> though Chriſt as God coequal and coeternal with the Father ſhall <hi>reign for ever,</hi> yet not as the <hi>Lamb,</hi> which is clear, 1 Cor. 15.28. <hi>And when all things ſhall be ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56286:132"/>him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all, i.e.</hi> the humane nature of Chriſt which dyed for our ſins, roſe again (as the Apoſtle in the foregoing verſes ſpeaketh) was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> above all the Creatures, all the time of the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> and the <hi>General Judgement</hi> (according to which nature, Chriſt is ſaid to be the Lamb ſlain) ſhall now be ſubjected, after the end, to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or Divine nature, which in Heaven ſhall be all in all; ſo that Chriſt as the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſhall not have a <hi>Throne</hi> there. And this Interpretation is not ſo much mine, as <hi>Auguſtines</hi> long ago, and <hi>Calvins</hi> ſince, who both ſpeak the ſame thing, confeſſing a ſubjection of the humanity of Chriſt to be here intimated, whom I think good here to name, not that their Authority, nor my ſaying ſo, proves the thing to be truth; but that I might hereby ſtop the mouths of ſuch, who otherwiſe poſſibly, would be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the truth it ſelf for error.</p>
                        <p>Yet let none hence conclude (as ſome now adays fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) a <hi>ceſſation</hi> of the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> by being <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> into the <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſo as that Chriſt ſhall be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man no longer; for the Apoſtle in ſaying the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> ſhall be ſubject, denotes plainly, that the ſame ſhall even in <hi>Heaven hereafter</hi> have a <hi>being;</hi> for how can that be ſubject, which hath no being?</p>
                        <p>And as the <hi>Lambs</hi> having a <hi>Throne</hi> in the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> proves clearly that it cannot be meant of <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory</hi> after the day of Judgement; ſo doth it as ſtrongly prove (what before I have laid down) that not a <hi>Spiritual</hi> onely, buth a <hi>Perſonal preſence</hi> of Chriſt ſhall be with his people in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> all the time of the <hi>thouſand years;</hi> for Chriſt as the <hi>Lamb</hi> hath his <hi>Throne</hi> in it; but Chriſt <hi>Spiritually onely,</hi> is not the <hi>Lamb,</hi> nor was he <hi>ſacrifiſed</hi> in that ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, Becauſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. (which Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56286:132"/>as is moſt evident, ſpeaks not of <hi>heavenly glory,</hi> but of a glorious ſtate of the Church here on Earth) is for <hi>time</hi> one and the <hi>ſame</hi> with this, as plainly will appear by comparing one with the other.</p>

(both as I have ſhewed being to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to one and the ſame time) which is this, Seeing <hi>John</hi> in deſcribing the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw no Temple therein,</hi> Chap. 21.22. and the contrary is here intimated, <hi>There came a great voyce out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Heaven;</hi> how can theſe things agree? or the one be made Expoſitory of the other, when they ſpeak things contradictory.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, <hi>John</hi> ſaw no <hi>material Temple,</hi> ſuch as was in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, to which here <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> is oppoſed.</p>
                        <p>Or ſecondly, (which I rather incline to) <hi>John</hi> ſaw no ſuch Temple as was the former Temple, or <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> under the Goſpel.

                        <p>And to this day (as I conceive) have thoſe Scriptures reference, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brether, ſaying, Know the Lord, for the ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them,</hi> Iſa. 54.31. <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing an immediate feeding and teaching, not ſo much by inſtruments means, and Ordinances, as the Lord himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And though it is not denied theſe Scriptures had a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling in the beginnings, when the Spirit was poured down, teaching then (Chriſt promiſing, and ſending his Spirit for that end) being more abundant and ſpiritual than in former times, for which cauſe they are by Chriſt himſelf, and <hi>Paul</hi> after him, interpreted as then fulfilled; yet it is evident from the ſcope of thoſe places whence theſe Texts are quoted, that the Prophets had in their eye another time, namely, the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery, when not <hi>Judah</hi> only, but <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Head of the ten Tribes alſo, ſpoken of expreſly by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> ſhould return; yea the very time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe ſtones are therefore by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid to be <hi>laid with fair colours, her foundations with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires, her windows of Agates, her gates with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, and all her borders with pleaſant ſtones;</hi> not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56286:135"/>unlike that deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem John</hi> gives us (but more full) <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. of that, although in part theſe Scriptures had a fulfilling before (in which ſenſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> mention them) yet the fulneſs, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fulfilling of them, reſpects the time we are ſpeaking of.</p>
                        <p>And doth not the phraſe of <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Iſaiah, Peter, John,</hi> and ever with reference to this time, imply as much? for the very phraſe of making a <hi>new,</hi> implies the aboliſhing of the <hi>old;</hi> which new made, that it cannot conſiſt of any ſuch outward things as did the old, is clear, becauſe upon the aboliſhing of the old, ſuch things, only are left ſtanding in this new, as can never be ſhaken, or removed, which all outward things are ſubject to.</p>

                        <p>I anſwer; If by <hi>worſhipping</hi> the Lord, and <hi>keeping the Feaſt of Tabernacles</hi> we underſtand <hi>a walking in Ordinances,</hi> then ſhall the <hi>Ordinances</hi> at this day bee common to all, even the worſt of ſinners, for that ſuch at this day ſhall be in the world, hath been before proved; and obſerve, the <hi>comand</hi> to <hi>come</hi> up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>worſhip</hi> the Lord, and to <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles</hi> is <hi>general,</hi> upon all that are left of thoſe who came up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>All the Families of the earth,</hi> verſ. 17. yea the very <hi>Heathen,</hi> verſ. 18. and if <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> ſhall be ſo common at this day, then will the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of worſhip in reſpect of the Worſhippers be leſs then, than now it is; and if ſo, where then will be the <hi>holineſs</hi> of this day, which in this reſpect is to excel all dayes before it?</p>
                        <p>The meaning therefore (I conceive) is this, That all people in remembrance of the terrible deſtruction Chriſt made of his enemies, gathered together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon his appearing, ſhall from that day, year after year, <hi>i.e.</hi> often come and worſhip before the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> fall down before this Chriſt ſitting on the Throne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him to be the great <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, to the glory of God the Father, fulfilling that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> Chap. 45.23. <hi>

(which diſcovers the great <hi>Whore,</hi> and her ruine, Chap. 17.18. gives us a general view of the Bride, the <hi>Lambs</hi> wife, and her attire, and Chriſt her Husbands coming, and appearing to deſtroy her enemies, and marry his Spouſe to himſelf, Chap. 19. makes diſcovery, that before the <hi>General Judgement</hi> ſhall be a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> in which Satan ſhall be bound, and the Saints ſhall reign with Chriſt, Cha. 20. gives us alſo a general hint of the glory of this <hi>thouſand years,</hi> Ch. 21. v. 1. to 9.) was all of it revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>John</hi> in the Wilderneſs, teaching us hereby, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yet the Woman is got clear out of the Wilderneſs there ſhall be a full diſcovery of theſe things.

                        <p>And as in theſe, ſo in many other places, where the <hi>New Jeruſalems glory</hi> is deſcribed by the Prophets, we have ſometimes long life intimated, <hi>The childe ſhall die an hundred years old; as the daies of a tree, are the daies of my people.</hi> Sometimes <hi>building houſes, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vineyards</hi> &amp;c. as if the great <hi>glory</hi> were to lye in ſuch things, which is not ſo; but as <hi>Ezekiels Temple</hi> hath in <hi>his deſcription</hi> a great deal of outward bravery, ſuitable to ſuch a <hi>Temple,</hi> as their thoughts to whom he ſpake were moſt taken up with, yet is in a <hi>word interpreted</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> to be <hi>another</hi> manner of thing, viz. <hi>the Lamb,</hi> and <hi>his Throne,</hi> ſo theſe things are ſpoken rather by way of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention</hi> to their weakneſs, who ſtanding under an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant, in which ſuch things were promiſed, were exceedingly pleaſed with things of this nature, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much at them, making a greater account of them, than as the things in themſelves are, or will appear to be; when this day ſhall come.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 RULE, That the coming of Gods people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> building the ſecond Temple, and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being all an eminent Type of the thing I am ſpeaking of, therefore <hi>in ſome Scriptures</hi> where we read of <hi>this glory,</hi> under that deliverance as a Type, <hi>we are to look upon ſome things to have their fulfilling then in the Type, ſome others to be fulfilled for time to come in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.</hi>

                        <p>To <hi>this Rule</hi> appertain not a few places in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, eſpecially in <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechary,</hi> who <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied</hi>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56286:139"/>upon <hi>the coming</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and at <hi>the time the ſecond Temple was building,</hi> as <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9. the Prophet hath <hi>reference</hi> to <hi>the ſecond Temple</hi> as a <hi>Type,</hi> which he calls <hi>the latter houſe,</hi> v. 9. but whilſt he ſpeaks of <hi>ſhaking Heaven &amp; Earth, the deſire of all Nations coming,</hi> and thereupon the glory of the <hi>latter houſe</hi> to ſurpaſs <hi>the glory of the former</hi> built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> in all theſe things it hath <hi>relation</hi> (as in our former Diſcourſe hath been proved) to the time of <hi>Chriſts ſecond coming,</hi> and <hi>the ſtate</hi> of <hi>the new Jeruſalem.</hi>

                        <p>So alſo in <hi>Zechary,</hi> where we have ſeveral Propheſies concerning <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> being built, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 8. ſome things had their <hi>fulfilling</hi> then, in that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was afterwards built by <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> as when it is ſaid; <hi>Jeruſalem ſhould again be inhabited as a Town without wals, for the multitude of men and cattel therein,</hi> Chap. 2.4. <hi>There ſhould be yet old men, and old women dwel in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the ſtreets of the City ſhould be full of Boyes, and Girles, playing in the ſtreets thereof,</hi> chap. 8.4.5. which things were afterwards fulfilled. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> betwixt <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, and the time of <hi>Chriſts coming</hi> being inhabited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and grown <hi>populous,</hi> which when <hi>Zechary</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied was but a <hi>ruinous heap;</hi> or in caſe theſe things are to be <hi>extended</hi> further, to the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>the New Ieruſalem,</hi> we are to interpret them according to our <hi>firſt Rule;</hi> but now there are other things, as <hi>many Nations being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord in that day, becoming his people, and the Lord himſelf dwelling in the midſt of them,</hi> chap. 2.11. <hi>The coming of many people, and the inhabitants of many Cities,</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants of one City ſaying to another, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> yea, <hi>many people, and ſtrong nations coming to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts in</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and to pray before the Lord,</hi> chap. 8.20, 21, 22.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56286:139"/>Theſe things <hi>relate</hi> to <hi>the time</hi> of the <hi>New Ieruſalem,</hi> yet ſo as we muſt alſo interpret the Prophets manner of ſpeaking, and ſetting forth theſe things according to our <hi>firſt Rule.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 RULE, That as the Goſpel Adminiſtration (which was when the Prophets wrote to come) was to be a very conſiderable ſtep towards <hi>the glory</hi> of <hi>the new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> things being under it to make a great advance in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, in compariſon of what then they were; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof a beginning, or a peeping forth of <hi>new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems glory,</hi> ſhould be held forth in that Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Hence we are to look upon ſome places in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets where this glory is ſpoken of, as relating in part, and in ſome things to the ſtate of the Church under the Goſpel Adminiſtration that now is, but to have a more ſpecial relation in regard of the Prophets ſcope, to the ſtate of the New Ieruſalem, which is yet to come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is clear from the Scriptures before mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31.34. <hi>They ſhall no more teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord;</hi> which places (as I have ſaid) have an accompliſhment in part at preſent, but for their fulneſs, they look to the time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which is yet to come.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11. <hi>Thoſe that are aſhamed of their abominations ſhall have the form and faſhion of Gods houſe ſhewed to them;</hi> and chap 44.10, 11. <hi>The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> that <hi>went aſtray</hi> when <hi>Iſrael went aſtray,</hi> are <hi>laid by</hi> in the ſpecial acts of <hi>Gods worſhip;</hi> but v. 15, 16. they that <hi>kept</hi> their <hi>charge</hi> when the reſt went <hi>aſtray,</hi> are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed</hi> in the <hi>ſervice</hi> of Gods Sanctuary and Table; which things (in a ſpiritual way) God hath fulfilled, and is daily fulfilling to his people, under the preſent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, though yet the general ſcope of this Propliecy (as before) looks to the time of the <hi>New Ieruſalem.</hi>

                              <p>The firſt ſtand under the Banner of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> The two laſt being one in this, that neither pretends to ſtand up for Chriſt, as doth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (who ſhall at this day by the ſubtlety, Miracles and counterfeit holineſs of the falſe Prophet, be marvellouſly blinded, being made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his cauſe to be quite contrary to what indeed it is) but coming forth upon the account of ſome carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, or worldly intereſts, yet mixed with malice (which is natural to all that are of the Serpentine ſeed) againſt the Saints, are both comprehended under that of the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19. <hi>I ſaw the Beaſt, and the Kings of the earth.</hi>

                                 <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7. deſcribes them otherwiſe (though not much differing) calling the firſt (as here) the <hi>Beaſt,</hi>
                                 <pb n="168" facs="tcp:56286:141"/>which I have ſhewed to be the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> as governed by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>little Horn;</hi> the other, the reſt of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> verſ 12. noting other worldly powers, who ſhall joyn hands at this day with <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or the <hi>fourth Beaſt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now that <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with other Kings of the earth, as his adherents, ſhall at this day make one Head, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Saints, is without queſtion, but yet perhaps it may be thought ſufficient proof hath not (from what hath been ſaid) appeared to evidence that the <hi>great Turk,</hi> or the <hi>Mahumetan party</hi> ſhall joyn with the reſt, or ſhould be comprehended under that of the Kings of the earth.</p>
                              <p>Now although no leſs can be thought, when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in ſuch general termes, verſ. 14. <hi>The Kings of the earth, and of the whole world,</hi> then that the <hi>Turk,</hi> who poſſeſſeth a <hi>great part of the world,</hi> ſhould be included, yet (that the ſenſe of the words may be more clear) I ſhall from other Scriptures prove that the <hi>great Turk</hi> ſhall have a hand, yea a deep one too, in this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ingagement.</p>
                              <p>Not much to inſiſt upon (becauſe I would not bee prolix) the gathering together of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.39. which divers worthy men, and not without giving good reaſons for it) interpret the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Turk</hi> which gathering together that it is the ſame with that at this day, the ſeveral circumſtances of the place do evidence, as will appear to him who ſhall compare the battel of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> with this of <hi>Armageddon;</hi> and not (as ſome) that ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8, 9. which mentions no battel, as doth <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> nor will that agree to the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery (which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is clear in) but rather ſhould be a <hi>thouſand years</hi> after; neither can there (the <hi>General Judgement</hi> immediately inſuing thereupon) be any allowance of time, either to bury <hi>Gog's</hi>
                                 <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56286:141"/>dead, or for a <hi>glorious ſtate of the Church</hi> here on earth; both which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks punctually unto; yet well may thoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. being ſuch of the ſeed of old <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> as ſhall ſurvive the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> and ſhall at the end thereof (upon the Devils letting looſe) act againſt the Saints, as their Fore-fathers did, retain the names of their Anceſtors <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſtill. But to paſs this, I take it, thoſe places (which are not a few) in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, where mention is made of the <hi>rage of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have a ſpecial <hi>reference</hi> to the thing I am now in proving, for whereas the <hi>Turk</hi> doth at this day poſſeſs <hi>Chaldea, Meſopotamia,</hi> with ſuch other Countries, as did anciently belong to the <hi>Aſſyrian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi> ſo do I conceive what the Prophets oft hint at, as touching the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> invading <hi>Iſrael</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be rather <hi>Typical</hi> of what ſhould be in the laſt dayes, acted by his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> than a plenary <hi>fulfilling</hi> of thoſe <hi>Propheſies</hi> by any <hi>Invaſions</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> in, or about thoſe times, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.31. <hi>For through the voyce of the Lord ſhall the Aſſyrian be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down;</hi> Which Text, although I deny not, but it had a <hi>typical</hi> accompliſhment in the dayes of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> yet doth not that anſwer the ſcope of the Chapter, which it is manifeſt looks to the laſt dayes, and how the 30, 31, 32, 33 verſes agrees to what we have formerly ſpoken, as touching <hi>Chriſts coming</hi> at the battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> will be clear to him who ſhall but compare ſundry places which upon that occaſion I have opened before with this.</p>
                              <p>As for that of <hi>Micha, Chap.</hi> 5.5. <hi>This man ſhall bee the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our Land;</hi> It cannot be interpreted as having <hi>reference</hi> to any other but <hi>Goſpel-times,</hi> long before which the ancient <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy</hi> was ruined. And would you know what <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it hath <hi>reference</hi> unto? why the <hi>laſt time</hi> of all, <hi>viz. The time of Chriſts coming,</hi> and ſecond appearing, verſ. 4, 5, 6.</p>

                              <p>Having thus found the <hi>parties</hi> who ſhall at this day bee gather together to oppoſe the <hi>Saints</hi> which march under <hi>three diſtinct Banners.</hi> 1 The <hi>Banner</hi> of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Roman power</hi> governed by <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> 2 The <hi>Banner</hi> of <hi>the Turk,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>the Mahumetan Religion.</hi> 3 The <hi>Banner</hi> of ſome <hi>earthly Kings</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> Adherents to the other two, yet neither <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans.</hi>

                              <p>I come now to make application hereof to the words, which notably ſet forth, and that diſtinctly the ruine of either party.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 <hi>The great City is divided into three parts.</hi> By <hi>Great City,</hi> we are not to underſtand <hi>the City Rome,</hi> which fell before under <hi>Vial</hi> 5. But <hi>the whole power of the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſts Kingdome,</hi> for ſo is the word uſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. <hi>The ſame hour there was a great Earthquake, and the tenth part of the City fell,</hi> i.e. <hi>One of the ten Horns, or the tenth part of Antichriſts Kingdome</hi> fell upon <hi>the Witneſſes</hi> riſe. Now the <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> of <hi>the Great City,</hi> notes the downfall and ruin of <hi>his whole Kingdome;</hi> for a <hi>City divided,</hi> or <hi>rent</hi> peece from peece, by ſome terrible ſhaking, or earthquake <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand;</hi> And <hi>this diviſion</hi> being into <hi>three parts,</hi> notes a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect ruine, three</hi> being a number of perfection. Now is <hi>the Beaſt ſlain, his body deſtroyed,</hi> and given to <hi>the burning flame,</hi> Dan. 7. <hi>Now the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, both are caſt into the Lake of fire burning with brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 19. <hi>Now thoſe who worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, and receive his mark in their fore-heads, or in their hands, drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the cup of his indignation, and are tormented
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56286:142"/>with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb. And the ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth up for ever; and they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name,</hi> Rev. 14.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 The <hi>Cities of the Nations fall, i.e.</hi> ſuch Nations as come in to the <hi>help</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Turk</hi> at this day, their Royal Cities, Regal Seats, Fortreſſes and places of ſtrength are overthrown. Now are the Thrones of Kingdoms overturned, and the ſtrength of Kingdoms of the Heathen deſtroyed, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.22. <hi>This is the day of Gods controverſie with all Nations, when the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be from one end of the earth, unto the other,</hi> Jer. 25.30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 <hi>Great Babylon comes up in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his wrath.</hi> Now by <hi>Great Babylon</hi> we may not underſtand the <hi>City Rome,</hi> which fell under the <hi>Fifth Vial;</hi> nor is it weight enough againſt our Reaſons there laid down, to ſay that the <hi>City Rome</hi> is <hi>ſpiritually called</hi> by the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Great Babylon,</hi> in this Book, unleſs it could be proved that the name in a ſpiritual ſenſe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to no other City, or thing, but <hi>Rome</hi> only.</p>
                              <p>Nor may we ſecondly, underſtand <hi>Antichriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in general,</hi> for that is ſet forth by the <hi>Great City;</hi> and it is not a thing probable, having once expreſſed it, and being gone to another Head namely, <hi>The Cities of the Nations,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould yet afterwards come over with it again. Yea how improper would it be to ſay of the Kingdom of the Beaſt, that it came now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God, which peece by peece had been pulling down, and deſtroying throughout all the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As therefore <hi>three ſorts</hi> of Enemies combine together at this day, the doom and downfall of <hi>two</hi> of which, we
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56286:143"/>have ſeen already; ſo is the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>third,</hi> namely, the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> with <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> his Royal City, or Seat of Reſidence here ſet forth by <hi>Great Babylons</hi> coming up in remembrance before God: And in this opinion I am not alone, <hi>(Brightman)</hi> a man of no little worth and eſteem, having aſſerted it before me.</p>
                              <p>And truly the <hi>Turk,</hi> being, as hath been made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſo <hi>conſiderable</hi> an Enemy in this laſt ingagement, it is not probable that his <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſhould either be paſſed over in <hi>ſilence,</hi> or named in the <hi>general</hi> only, which if it be not contained in theſe words, is ſo.</p>
                              <p>Withall there will be the ſame reaſon at this day, when the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Seat ſhall be as <hi>infamouſly</hi> famous for <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> and <hi>oppreſsing</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Antichriſts</hi> hath been, or now is, for perſecuting the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſenſe the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> (the oppreſſing City of Gods people of old) ſhould be applied to it, as now it is to the Seat of the Beaſt; yea if of the two one may claim a greater title to the name than the other, the claim of this day will fall to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who by poſſeſſing the cruel and perſecuting qualities of <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, towards Gods people ſhall make his claim equal with Antichriſt; and by how much he hath not the qualities only, but the Lands and Territories of the <hi>Babylonian Monarchy</hi> that was now in his clutches, his claim will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                              <p>And indeed to me it is evident that <hi>thoſe things</hi> that concern the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> mentioned ſo oft in the Prophets, which in the ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> of old (the Type) neither had, nor could have their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they have a reſpect to the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> both, yet more <hi>eſpecially</hi> to the <hi>Turk,</hi> as the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Antitype</hi> of that <hi>Type,</hi> as is clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. for the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> there ſpoken of, is that <hi>Babylon</hi> which ſhall be an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing City to the <hi>Jews</hi> (for which reaſon they triumph
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56286:143"/>over it in its deſtruction, verſ. 4, 5, &amp;c. and this at the time of their laſt reſtauration, which is yet to come, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the three firſt verſes, which can be meant of none ſo properly, as the <hi>Great Turk</hi> ſitting in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>

                              <p>And as a <hi>further Reſtauration</hi> ſeems to be promiſed, and foretold, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4 5. then meerly the coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> of Old, when <hi>Judah</hi> only, and not (as here) <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together, came up to ſeek the Lord; ſo by the ſame reaſon we are to look after the ruine of ſome other <hi>Babylon,</hi> then meerly <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Letter, which <hi>Babylo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>And notwithſtanding the <hi>Turk</hi> received a notable blow under the former <hi>Vial,</hi> by means of which a door was ſet open to the <hi>Jews</hi> to recover their own land; yet becauſe <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> his chief City was not thereby deſtroyed, therefore in reſpect of the wrath of God, poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that at this day, it is here ſaid, <hi>Great Babylon came now in remembrance before God;</hi> which words very fitly agree to the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but are not <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> either to the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> both which came up into <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> and had been <hi>actually puniſhed</hi> before this day.</p>

The love of the meaneſt Saint is precious to me, the favor of your Highneſs much more; but in theſe divided times, offering many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this nature, I have often remembred the caſe as it ſtood betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Peter, Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:56286:164"/>and although I am of all the moſt unworthy to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, or any thing of the mind of the Lord, yet is it my perſwaſion, that ſome of them are diſcovered in the following diſcourſe; and he that ſhall without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice read what in the cloſe is written of the time, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the things themſelves ſpecified throughout the Book, may poſſibly be of my mind, at leaſt not cenſure me for thinking ſo.

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> Let me not be made an offender for this plain dealing; if I am, ſo long as the Lord ſhall keep my feet in the way of my duty, it ſhall not trouble me, and I have hope that in this I have had his merciful guidance, and have not as yet ſtepped out of that way: For if in the day when Chriſt is going up to his Kingdom, the ſtones would not hold their peace, ſhould not the Children cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> then ſurely it is a duty very incumbent upon the Saints at this day (there being nothing more obvious than that Chriſt is well onwards upon his march to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) not to be ſilent, but although they may be rebuked, yea, dealt worſe by, for ſo doing, yet to follow their King with acclamations, which is all that ſuch poor creatures as we are can do for him. Nay, if it be a duty to expect from God returns of our prayers, then it is alſo a duty to have inſpection even into publick affairs ſo far as the managing of theſe may have a tendency to the furtherance or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe good things, which we hope we have been graciouſly holpen by the Lord, and alſo had ſome favorable ſmiles of his acceptance in ſeeking his face for. Nay, if it be a
<pb facs="tcp:56286:165"/>duty to obſerve and follow God in the way of his viſible diſpenſations; or on the contrary, a ſin to be of a ſluggiſh temper, not regarding the works of the Lord, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the operation of his hands, then of neceſſity muſt there be a reflection upon the publick actings of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either in a way of owning or diſowning, without which no obſervation can be made of Gods diſpenſations, or our duty in this reſpect. Nay laſtly; If it be a duty to mourn for the ſins of Rulers, to mourn when Chriſts cauſe lies bleeding, then certainly it cannot be evill to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the one, and the other.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding it is a more precious thing in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be found <hi>watching in his own heart and ways, than to be prying into the waies and actings of others,</hi> for which cauſe ſo far as this is neglected, the <hi>common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation</hi> laid to the charge of thoſe who contend for the Kingdom of Chriſt without, as if they did neglect the Kingdom of Chriſt within, is a thing moſt juſt: Yet let it withall be conſidered, that the doing of the one, layes no neceſſity upon a man of a neglect of the other; for if there be but any thing of truth in that opinion, it will be hard to ſay, <hi>God hath laid a neceſſity upon us to neglect our hearts, whilſt</hi> (which yet is a thing he wills us to do) <hi>we are ſeeking after his truth:</hi> And if through that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is within, any man ſhould ſo do, doth not this evill attend him, as well in other ſtudies as this? by conſequence therefore from this principle, <hi>no truth muſt be inquired into.</hi> But I have obſerved in this day a <hi>cloſe deſign</hi> of the Devil, driven on under this vizard, and no wonder, for Satan himſelf is now transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light; and I can the better ſpeak it, having felt, when time was, this temptation, and thereby learned theſe who Leſſons.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 I have learned likewiſe to <hi>diſcern ſomewhat of the depths of the heart, which would exerciſe the higheſt pride, under a pretext of great holineſs and humility:</hi> for it being indeed a moſt bleſſed thing to attend to inward purity and mortification, wherein lies the glory of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, now ſaith the heart, how ſtrangely do ſuch and ſuch contend for this outward thing and the other? well, I will follow none of them, but I will attend to the mortification of the inward man, I am ſure in that I ſhall be right. Now with this conceit the man goeth on ſecretly, bleſſing, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf, and he turns him and looks him round, and loe all are out of the way but he. Pride, as it quickly grows upon ſuch a root, ſo is it more abominable to God,
<pb facs="tcp:56286:166"/>by how much it is more ſpiritual, then that which may yee diſcover it ſelf more outwardly. Yet let me ſay thus doth the Devil, and mans heart at this day marvellouſly deceive many precious Saints in this thing, who are apt to think, that they cannot mind theſe things and as they ſhould ſtudy and look to their hearts too. Whereas indeed, it argues a Childiſh temper in a man, to think that he cannot learn the things of his heart, or keep the ſame up for God, any longer then it is exerciſed in thoſe truths which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern the heart and life, and have their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Chriſtian experience; as if thoſe truths which lie out of the reach of my experience as a Chriſtian, and more imediately concern Gods Cauſe and Glory without, had not in them as natural a tendency to give a ſoul a ſight of God, and as great an efficacy to cauſe the heart to cleave to God, and walk humbly with him, as truths that lye within the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, I will here be bold to ſay, that that ſoul who faithfully followeth God in thoſe things wherein his glory is more immediately concerned, ſhall learn more of his heart as it were by the by, and have the ſame better ordered, then ſhall that man, who neglecting this, makes that his continual ſtudy; for it is not by our poring that we come to know our hearts, nor by our ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to mend them, ſo much, as indeed by laying them in that path, where Chriſt in this or that day more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goes, and waiting there to receive life and ſtrength from him.</p>

And ſometimes I have thought, that when <hi>Daniel</hi> did mourn and afflict himſelf before God the ſecond time, three full weeks, Chap. 10.2. upon the account that the work of God in that age was put to a ſtand, by the power (as is by good men judged) of <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Cyrus</hi> Son, reigning while his Father was abroad in the wars, that had <hi>Cambyſes</hi> been a good man, or a man like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have been prevailed with, <hi>Daniel</hi> undoubtedty would (as did the Prophets before him, frequently to the good Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) have made other applications in that caſe, (and accounted the doing thereof his duty) than barely to the Lord alone. Nay, it is a mercy to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themſelves to have applications in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made unto them; for, <hi>Woe be to thoſe Governors,</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> Gods people <hi>fearing,</hi> or being <hi>without hopes</hi> in making addreſs, when they ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſee ſufferings coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his cauſe, retire themſelves and ſpread the affliction of their ſouls before the Lord alone.</p>
                  <p>Yet let me alſo ſay, it is a thing moſt certain, and that which is a prejudice to the very cauſe in the hearts of many, and ought to be matter of grief to all, that Saints in moſt places at this day, whilſt they are crying that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers work might go on, do act too much like men, and ſhew too much of their own ſpirits; yea, are very conſuſed as to the making out the things themſelves would have; and moreover, have many falling into their party, that <hi>injure</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:56286:167"/>very <hi>cauſe</hi> they ſtand up in: But I earneſtly wiſh it might be conſidered, that although the child when it cries, cannot alwayes give a rational account of the cauſe of its ſo doing, yea poſſibly may oftentimes diſcover much peeviſhneſs and paſſion in crying, yet doth it not ever cry without a cauſe; and the wiſdome of the Father is not ſo intent upon the weakneſſes of the child in crying, as to find out the cauſe why it cries.</p>
                  <p>And farther, ſhould not many and great weakneſſes appear in thoſe who ſtand up for Chriſts Kingdome, how ſhould his Kingdome come without obſervation? no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſervation than of holineſs, if ſo be the appearance of that in them were to be eminently viſible. <hi>John</hi> came with much outward Holineſſe, and hee came with great obſervation. Yea whether when the ſtrife roſe firſt betwixt the Brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way in England,</hi> did not many who yet had truth, and Chriſt did afterwards own before the world, <hi>ſtrive</hi> in many things like fooliſh peeviſh Children? and whether in the times of the Apoſtles, throughout the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ages, and almoſt ever ſince, have not the croud of errors alwayes run into that ſide where truth hath been? the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the grand enemies deſign is <hi>to ſow his tares in his enemies filed,</hi> his own, where as yet his title is not queſtioned, nor ſhaken, he will not meddle with.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things therefore (with others of a like nature) are not to be made definitive Concluſions as to a cauſe, which oftentimes God permits for the trial of Rulers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, his peoples faith, and the carrying on of his own cauſe in a cloud, which is the way he goes in, in moſt of his works of wonder. Governors becauſe of theſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages may inflict civil penalties if they will, yet let it bee conſidered, that the great King is now coming to his Throne, and there is not a Ruler in the world, but hath his ſtanding only <hi>protempore,</hi> to whom as all muſt give an account, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:56286:167"/>muſt they ſhortly <hi>ſurrender</hi> their <hi>Crowns,</hi> or they ſhall be taken from them; and if any of the ſubjects of this mighty King, whilſt they ſee their King upon his march, and are followed with hourly intelligence that he is neer, and ſuch and ſuch things muſt be done in order to his <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,</hi> by ſpeaking ſome words for their King, that <hi>things</hi> may be in a readineſs, and by giving abroad what intelligence they have to that end, ſhall offend, and ſuffer any thing for it, let it be remembred, that when the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous King is ſate upon his Throne, theſe things will not be huſht up, but it ſhall then be known, whether ſuch as ſhall ſo do, exceeded their Commiſſion, or not, did their own, or the Lord Chriſts will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> That through multitude of words, I may neither tire your patience, nor incur the cenſure of being one that loves to <hi>hear</hi> himſelf ſpeak, I ſhall wave ſome things, which otherwiſe I would yet have added, and draw to a Concluſion, only leaving with your Highneſs three or four plain, ſober, and in my opinion neceſſary words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Let your Highneſs oft remember, and ſet before you the example of that good man Aſa,</hi> who though he were a man of <hi>much zeal</hi> for God, and his Worſhip, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Altars of the ſtrange gods, and the High pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, breaking down the Images, cutting down the Groves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man of a <hi>tender conſcience,</hi> therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Mother from being Queen, becauſe ſhe made an Idol in a Grove; a man of <hi>much faith</hi> in the field, by which faith of his, he vanquiſhed the huge hoſt of <hi>Zerah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian;</hi> yet having made <hi>one eminent turn</hi> from God (as one turn from God makes way for another) he is afterwards in <hi>a rage at reproof,</hi> and caſts the Prophet into priſon that reproved him, and at the very ſame time <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the people of the LAND;</hi> and after all (what will Sin bring even a good man to?) When Gods hand is upon him for this, he ſeems as <hi>a man ſtubborn,</hi> and ſeeks not to
<pb facs="tcp:56286:168"/>the Lord, but to the Phyſicians; which that it may never be your Highneſs caſe, is my prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Let your hand be no way lifted up againſt any of the Saints in this Nation</hi> It was a good Poſition laid down by Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (in a Sermon preached upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105 14, 15. before the Parliament that was, at the time when the Brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way had the turning of the Wheel) and as well proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the dealing well or ill with the Saints, is, and hath ever been, the great intereſt of States and Kingdoms, that on which their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or ruine depends. All <hi>Sodome</hi> made not the hands of thoſe four Kings <hi>Abraham</hi> routed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. ſo weak, as <hi>their fingring one</hi> Lot.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Purſue not too hotly every righteous principle.</hi> It is an Obſervation of Dr. <hi>Owens,</hi> worthy never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten (preached (when time was) in a Sermon of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.24. to the aforeſaid powers) concerning prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that men take up, his words are theſe <hi>page</hi> 21.22. The moſt tremendous judgement of God in this world is the hardning the hearts of men. Now, ſaith he, firſt, Look on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of whom it is moſt ſignally ſpoken, that God hardned his heart: How did the Lord accompliſh this? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſettles himſelf upon as righteous principles as ever any of the Sons of men could do: One is, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the chief Ruler of a Nation to ſee to the profit and glory of that Nation. What more righteous principle is there in the world? Hence he concludes, that if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to ſee that the Realm receive no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he muſt not let the people go by whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo many great advantages: God confirms his heart in theſe principles, which are good in themſelves but (ſaith the Doctor) abominable when taken up againſt the mind and providence of God; Hence he, and his, periſhed in their principles, acting againſt the appearance of God. Secondly, It is alſo ſaid of <hi>Sihon</hi> the King of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56286:168"/>that his heart was hardned, that he would not let the people go through his Land. How I pray? even by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to that wiſe principle. That it is not meet to let a potent Enemy into the bowels of a people; and this made way for his ruine: Thus (ſaith he) it is with many; they fix on principles, good in general, and in their ſeaſon. Old bounds muſt not be broken up; Order muſt not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed: Let God appear never ſo eminently, ſo mightily, they will keep to their principle, what is this, but judicial hardneſs? And this is one reaſon why the actings of God in ſuch a day as this, are ſo unſuited to the expectations of men; they ſquare his works to the intereſts and principles, which it will not anſwer. Hitherto Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Take heed of that ungodly principle ſprung up of late</hi> (the contrary to which ſome call a State-Herene, though I am ſure the principle is a Scripture-Herefie) <hi>viz. That godlineſs in a Magiſtrate or Civil Officer, is but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary qualification; natural accompliſhments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments being the primary, for which therefore a man is to be intruſted with this power, rather than the other.</hi> I cannot but wonder how any who profeſs the Name of Chriſt, much more who profeſs themſelves to have been faithful to his cauſe, ſhould together therewith profeſs ſuch an unchriſt an, yea Machiavilian principle, which,</p>

But may we call ſuch of <hi>themſelves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Leaves <hi>out</hi> (as of little worth comparatively) <hi>the main qualifications of that divine pattern, by which the firſt Rulers that ever were ſo made by men amongſh Gods own people were made,</hi> Exod. 18.21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Makes <hi>null that Divine Maxime,</hi> 2 Sam.
<pb facs="tcp:56286:169"/>23.3. <hi>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God;</hi> for how can ſuch rule in the fear of God, who have no fear of God before their eyes? which is one character of every natural man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Layes <hi>an unavoidable neceſsity of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued judgement upon a people:</hi> For if it be a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have Rulers that know not God, becauſe ſuch make the people to <hi>erre, Iſa.</hi> 3.12. chap. 9.16. then if ſuch for their natural endowments are to be choſen, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt a judgement lye upon that <hi>people,</hi> over, or amongſt whom they are ſet.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Opens a <hi>door to all perſecution,</hi> by putting the Civil Sword into the hands of the Seed of the Serpent (for better cannot be ſaid of a meer moral man) which from the beginning hath had a natural enmity to the Seed of the Woman. <hi>My Lord,</hi> Bear with the boldneſs of it, if I ſay, <hi>That in caſe your Highneſs be found ſteering your courſe, and laying out your power by this crooked rule, know aſſuredly, that Chriſt will ſuddenly take</hi> (though how I know not) <hi>your power from you, and give it to one that ſhall lay it out otherwiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not multiply many more words, ſave to add, that in caſe any expreſſion, either in this, or the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſavour of the ſpirit of man (which my ſelf allows not, have kept a watch againſt, yet may be <hi>guilty</hi> of) I do in that humbly crave your Highneſs pardon; but as for the matter and ſubſtance of thoſe things I have written, I ask none, my Conſcience bearing me witneſs that I have afferted nothing, but what according to my preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions (not grounded upon this or that <hi>particular</hi> Text (which is a deceiving way) but by comparing the whole of Prophecies together) is the truth of Chriſt, yea the truth of the time; though yet (through mercy) I have drunk in no ſuch conceit of my own knowledge, as though it were more than in part; not do I impoſe upon your
<pb facs="tcp:56286:169"/>Highneſs conſcience, or the conſciences of any, a belief of my principles, any farther then Scripture and right reaſon doth approve them; yet would have none on the other ſide condemn them (as this age is apt to do) upon the account of this, or that ſingle Text, till he hath compared the whole of Prophecies together, in doing which, he may perhaps ſee my reaſon of ſtating things as I have done, which upon every occaſion I could not bring forth, and therewith a full anſwer to his own doubt. And farther, I have not in this work <hi>knowingly</hi> ſtretched any one Text, beyond what I have judged its due bounds, or forced an interpretation to reach any Party a blow: Nor have I on the other ſide with-held any peece of the truth (ſo judged by me) lying in any Text; nor minced any Interpretation to ſpare any party a blow: As I would be loath to ſtrike any my ſelf, for my blows can do me no good, and them little hurt; ſo would I not have a hand in keeping off that blow that truth will ſtrike, whoſoever it fall upon.</p>
                  <p>And although a Diſcourſe of this nature would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have become a graver Pen than mine, and poſſibly from ſuch a one been ſooner hearkned to (pride, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and headineſs, having been the coutinual accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation laid againſt <hi>young</hi> men, and not alwayes ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) yet ſeeing the Aged ſilent, and perceiving through the light the Lord of his grace hath larely given me to ſee, by a cleer opening ſundry Prophecies, which not long ſince were myſteries to me, the cauſe of Chriſt in ſore travel, either through an ignorance of what Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are at this day, or ſomewhat worſe in thoſe that ſhould manage it; I conceived my ſelf (though others might better do it, yet at this time) called to ſpeak, and to ſpeak plainly. <hi>Elihu,</hi> though a young man, went, and that with ſucceſs, over the head of ſuch a temptation, in a leſs caſe.

                  <p>As touching our dear, and worthy Brother (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) it may be expected ſomething by us ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but his deſire as concerning himſelf, hath laid ſilence upon us; Yet this we ſhall ſay, As we conceive him to be one who hath received much light from the Lord, and eſteems it a choice and ſpecial mercy to be taught of God the things of Chriſts Kingdom ſo we are his witneſſes, how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably he hath, and doth behave himſelf amongſt us (and many others) that beleeve.</p>
                  <p>As for the Treatiſe it ſelf, it needs not mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, becauſe Truth commends it ſelf: Yet this we ſay, It hath been a great refreſhment to our ſpirits, and we hope will be to the ſpirits of Gods people elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>It is the Authors deſire that things may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb facs="tcp:56286:171"/>on your parts without trial, yet in caſe any who fear the Lord, be in this matter otherwiſe minded, it is our deſire they would not raſhly condemn that, which was neither raſhly undertaken, nor publiſhed. But to come to what we have further to ſay.</p>
                  <p>It is an undeniable truth, confirmed by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Devil hath ever had a great deſign againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, that holy City, and hath ſo far prevailed, as by his inſtruments to tread it underfoot for a long time, though not able to deſtroy it. So that thoſe that have appeared, and witneſſed for Chriſt, have been forced to do it in ſackcleath, in a very mean and low condition, yet however they do it, they will do it, though in ſackcloath. And this hath been ſuch a trouble, and torment to the Beaſt, and the dwellers on the earth, that like men, or rather Devils, full of rage and fury againſt them, they make War againſt them, overcome them, pull off even their ſackcloath, ſtrip them, kill them. And whether this hath been already done, or is yet to do, is the great Queſtion, which this Treatiſe will give ſome light into, and a little time will more fully determine.</p>
                  <p>And that thoſe that dwell upon the earth, Chriſts enemies, ſhould rejoyce, and make merry when they ſee Chriſts Witneſſes (who tormented them by witneſſing) lye dead, is not to be thought ſtrange. But that the Lord ſhould be ſo tender, and mindful of thoſe that appear and witneſs for him, as after a little while to give life unto them, and not only to ſet them upon their feet, but to raiſe them up to an high, and glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that in the ſight of their enemies (greatly fearing, and trembling to behold it) is very affecting, and comfortable to our hearts to conſider.</p>
                  <p>And, Dear Brethren, having had ſome ſerious thoughts both of the ſpirits and wayes of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb facs="tcp:56286:171"/>people, at this time, we cannot apprehend that the LORD hath yet performed his <hi>whole work upon Mount Sion,</hi> but that he hath yet much to do, yea, though the Lord hath been a long time purging his people, and hath cut off <hi>two parts,</hi> and left onely a <hi>third,</hi> yet there is ſo much filth and droſs in that, that ſurely he will bring the third part <hi>through the fire,</hi> and will refine them, as <hi>Silver is refined,</hi> and will try them as <hi>Gold is tried.</hi> And what condition the Lord hath yet to bring his people into (to take away their droſs in) is beſt known to himſelf. And may not the people of the Lord, even after he hath done much for them, &amp; in them (yet polluted with ſeveral abominations) expect ſome hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be tried, and purged in, which may alſo be at hand?</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing we are ſpeaking, and ſpeaking to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that know how to bear with our weakneſſes, though we be poor ſtammering creatures, we ſhall take liberty and boldneſs to ſpeak a few things to you as plainly as we can, it being now high time to deal faithfully and plainly with one another, and to tell you more particularly what we fear.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, Brethren, we <hi>are afraid,</hi> from a ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the coldneſs and remiſneſs of our own hearts, that the charge of Chriſt againſt <hi>Epheſus</hi> will not fall upon us onely, but upon other of the Churches, and Saints of Chriſt, that they have <hi>left their firſt Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We <hi>are afraid,</hi> becauſe we are ſo earthly minded our ſelves, that ſome of you <hi>may be tempted alſo to ſeek other things before the Kingdom of God,</hi> and to take too much thought what you ſhall eat, and what you ſhall put on, what profits, preferments, and incouragements you ſhall have in the world (which are the things the men of the world ſeek after) for the obtaining of which you may be prone to ſeek to pleaſe and ſerve men, rather than Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>We <hi>are afraid,</hi> becauſe we have ſo little our ſelves, that <hi>a ſpirit of ſelf-denial ſhould be wanting among you,</hi> and that you ſhould not have hearts to rejoyce when Chriſt doth increaſe, if you ſhould decreaſe, and ſo lie open to that great, (and common evill) of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt, Chriſts intereſt, to uphold and maintain your own.</p>

                  <p>We <hi>are afraid,</hi> becauſe we our ſelves are not Virgins, chaſt, and faithful to the perſon and intereſt of the Lord Chriſt, leſt <hi>your hearts ſhould be enſnared, and polluted by any, through the leaſt compliance with, or liking of the great Whore,</hi> that hath deceived and defiled ſo many with her abeminations.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>are afraid,</hi> becauſe we have neglected it ſo much, and ſo long, leſt <hi>you ſhould forget to ſtudy, and enquire into the great and marvellous things that God is doing, for exaltation of his own name and Son.</hi> And what the Saints ought to do for God at ſuch a time as this. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlike to the Children of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> which were men that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the times, to know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>are afraid,</hi> becauſe we are ſo carnal, and walk ſo much by ſenſe our ſelves, <hi>that there ſhould not be ſuch a living by faith amongſt you, as the word and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God require,</hi> eſpecially when we hear ſo many of thoſe, who formerly hoped, and quietly waited for the Redemption of Gods choſen, now (being fearful, and unbeleeving) ſpeak like <hi>Mary, How ſhall this thing be,</hi> ſeeing we know not how it ſhould be brought to paſs?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56286:172"/>
                  <p>We <hi>are afraid</hi> likewiſe, becauſe our own hands are ſo heavy, and we unable, of our ſelves, to keep them ſteady, leſt your <hi>hands of prayer ſhould be let down at this time, and</hi> Amaleck <hi>ſhould prevail againſt</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>And if theſe things ſhould be found amongst you (of which we muſt confeſs our ſelves to be very guilty) how ought you, and we to fear and tremble, and lye low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, being very unworthy of, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all thoſe great and terrible things which his hand hath wrought for us?</p>
                  <p>And if we have not had, nor yet have hearts, holy, and heavenly, and spiritual enough to walk before him with, under his former, and preſent diſpenſations towards us, how ſhall we be able to ſtand before the Son of Man, when he ſhall appear in far greater power, and glory? And to follow him in thoſe ſtrange, and untrodden Paths that he hath yet to lead his people in, and thorow?</p>
                  <p>Surely it is <hi>now time</hi> for us (having been hitherto ſo much wanting in it) to <hi>conſider our hearts and ways,</hi> and thoſe wayes that the Lord calls us to wait upon him in.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is <hi>now time</hi> for us, who have left our firſt Iove to the Lord Jeſus (for which we have cauſe to be aſhamed before the Lord) not onely to <hi>remember from whence we are fallen, and to do our firſt works,</hi> to love him as much we have done formerly, but having taſted more of his goodneſs, and ſeen more of his glory (and hoping to behold much more of it) <hi>to love him more than ever we did;</hi> and oh that we had hearts to do it at this time.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is <hi>now time</hi> for thoſe Saints, that have had, and have their hearts eſpouſed to carnal and worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, as outward glory, honor, riches, &amp;c. <hi>to look up to the Lord, and to get their hearts diſ-ingaged, and ſet looſe from the world, and the things of the world,</hi> and to
<pb facs="tcp:56286:173"/>be for ever hereafter without ſo much as a thought of ſeeking great things for themſelves, as becommeth Saints.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is <hi>now time</hi> for the Spouſe, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friends of Chriſt, <hi>to caſt off, and abandon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and compliance with Antichriſt,</hi> and to keep themſelves ſo pure, and to approve themſelves ſo true to Chriſt, that if the Devil ſhould tempt them (as he did their Lord) by profering them all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, yet never to fall down, and any way worſhip that Beaſt. It argued a very <hi>chaſte and faithful heart,</hi> in that worthy Man, Maſter <hi>John Knox,</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt, that when <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, King of <hi>England,</hi> offered him a Biſhopricke, he refuſed it, as having <hi>Aliquid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune cum Antichriſto,</hi> ſomething of Antichriſtianiſm in it.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is <hi>now time</hi> for us, not onely to <hi>beleeve in Chriſt</hi> (which many think is all they need to do) but alſo <hi>to own him in this hour of his patience</hi> (wherein he looks to beowned by his Saints) <hi>leſt he frown upon us in the day of his great power, and glory, which draweth near.</hi> And Brethren, let us make it our chief, even our onely Deſign, and count it our greateſt Priviledge (though we ſhall be men wondered at for it) to follow, and ſerve the Lord Chriſt in faithfulneſs, and like <hi>Luther,</hi> in the cauſe of Chriſt, be content (though our low and carnal hearts may tremble at the very thoughts of it) to undergo the hatred, and violence of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Neither let us be <hi>too much troubled, nor offended at thoſe changes, alterations, and deſolations, which do, and may, and as Chriſt hath ſaid, will attend the going on, and advancement of his Kingdom in the world;</hi> which was that which ſome, may be, wel-meaning people objected to <hi>Luther,</hi> That that doctrin could not be of God, that was
<pb facs="tcp:56286:173"/>attended with ſuch troubles, and deſolations; who replyed thus, <hi>Ego niſrtumultus iſtos viderem, Chriſtum in mundo eſſe non crederem,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs I ſhould ſee thoſe troubles and tumults, I ſhould not beleeve Chriſt to be in the world. So Brethren, if we ſhould hear of Wars, and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and upon the earth diſtreſs of Nations, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth, let us not be terrified, nor offended, but (as our Savior hath bidden us) look up, and lift up our heads, for our redemption draweth nigh.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it is <hi>high time,</hi> awake, <hi>Awake oh Saints, lift up your hearts, and cry mightily unto the Lord, and never hold your peace day nor night, and give him no reſt</hi> (for it will not be long) <hi>till he eſtabliſh and make</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi> Stand therefore with your loyns girded about, and your lights burning; And ye your ſelves like men that wait for their Lord, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as he hath ſaid) as a Thief in the night, who may be upon you before you are aware, in an hour that you think not of. And however you may be hardly uſed, and beaten of your Fellow-ſervants, and Brethren too, who ſay their Lord delayeth his coming: Yet be not wearied, nor faint in your minds becauſe of theſe things, but be ye patient, Brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold the Husband-man waiteth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, untill he receive the early, and latter rain: Be ye alſo patient, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>
                  <p>Grudge not one againſt another, Brethren, leſt ye be condemned, behold the Judge ſtandeth before the door. For he cometh, he cometh to judge the earth, He ſhall judge the world with righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56286:174"/>
                  <p>And you that are of a fearful heart, be ſtrong, and fear not, behold your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence, he will come, and ſave you, and will perform all his good word towards you, and give you an expected end.</p>
                  <p>Caſt not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. <hi>For yee have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe. For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. Now the juſt ſhall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>

                  <p>That you, and we, continuing in all well-doing, and ſuffering, may be found unto praiſe, and honor, and glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, is the prayer of</p>

<pb facs="tcp:56286:175"/>thoughts; which after a while, ſeeing truth daily to come in at that door, I turning to view, ſaw (as I thought) a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod laid before me, which did ſeem to me to take off, and that in a great meaſure, the veil from many of the principal Apocalyptical viſions. Which <hi>obſerving</hi> and <hi>perceiving</hi> the ſame would be very <hi>conducible</hi> (could the thing it ſelf be made out) to the <hi>clearing</hi> up of many <hi>myſteries,</hi> chiefly relating to the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and alſo be a good <hi>foundation</hi> for many other <hi>Truths;</hi> which where a <hi>right order</hi> is not found, muſt needs lye <hi>buried;</hi> ſeeing there can be no <hi>ſound interpretation</hi> of the Apocalyps, nor any <hi>certain concluſion</hi> drawn from the <hi>whole</hi> or any <hi>part</hi> of it, till firſt the <hi>true order</hi> and <hi>proper place</hi> of each <hi>Viſion</hi> is found out; <hi>Crder</hi> being the <hi>foundation</hi> of all <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> and not Interpretation of it; I did therefore <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi> the thing it ſelf, <hi>comparing</hi> ſuch <hi>grounds</hi> as I had in my eye, for my <hi>own,</hi> with the <hi>grounds</hi> of others laid down in their writings, for <hi>theirs.</hi> Having <hi>done this</hi> (I ſpeak it not in the leaſt to my own commendation, nor the diſparagement of ſuch good and worthy men, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are extant on this Prophecy, of whoſe grace and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities I have a far greater eſteem, than either I have, or would have of my own) I found my ſelf much <hi>more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> in my conceptions, than when I <hi>began,</hi> finding in <hi>moſt</hi> no other <hi>Argument,</hi> beſides what lay in their <hi>bare</hi> Interpretations, which (as I have ſaid before) being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>Order,</hi> can be no <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Order.</hi> And as for the <hi>Arguments</hi> of others, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at firſt to carry weight, I found them upon <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> either too <hi>weak</hi> to conclude the <hi>thing,</hi> or elſe to be <hi>miſapplied:</hi> And indeed <hi>ſuch,</hi> as that the <hi>method</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> rightly ſtated, there would be <hi>little</hi> need of giving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>anſwers</hi> to them, for they would fall of <hi>themſelves.</hi> Hereupon I began to put my thoughts into ſuch an <hi>order,</hi> as ſeemed to me moſt to <hi>conduce</hi> to the making clear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:56286:175"/>appertaining to this <hi>great myſtery</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> which I have done in three Chapters: Whereof, the firſt Chapter repreſents <hi>the ſtate and condition of the Witneſſes, chiefly as to their prophecying and killing time;</hi> and that from part of the Eleventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the undoubted (and as is generally conceived, the onely) Prophecy of the Witneſſes. The ſecond Chapter <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms many of the Pofitions laid down in the former,</hi> by opening of the Twelfth Chapter, and proving it to run parallel with ſo much of the eleventh, as relates to the <hi>Witneſſes prophecying, and killing time.</hi> The third Chapter is a <hi>repreſentation of the happy condition the Church of Chriſt ſhall be in, about the time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes reſurrection; ſhewing alſo how the work ſhall go on from that time untill the Day of Chriſts Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> and this from opening the fourteenth Chapter, which is proved to be <hi>a Prophecy of the ſtate of the Church,</hi> and that from about the <hi>time of the Witneſſes riſe, untill the Second coming of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now although the <hi>ſubject</hi> it ſelf leads me to <hi>treat</hi> of <hi>many things</hi> in a <hi>prophetical</hi> manner, the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of which I <hi>conceive</hi> to be <hi>near</hi> at <hi>hand;</hi> yet do I not in the <hi>leaſt aſſume</hi> to my ſelf the <hi>title</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> of ſuch a thing as being a <hi>Prophet;</hi> onely by <hi>weighing Scriptures,</hi> and comparing one place with another, I draw up <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural grounds</hi> that in all likelihood ſuch and ſuch things will ſhortly be done. And although I judge my ſelf, that I may be deceived, ſo far as it is a thing poſſible that the <hi>diſcovering time</hi> may not be come, or that there may be after the moſt diligent and impartial inquiry, yet a miſſing of the time to which a Prophecy relates, which if miſſed, the miſtake muſt needs be totall, and all Interpretations falſe; Or if not a nuſſing of the time (which it is hoped in this little peece is not, my care having been above all to attain a right principle herein, it being the onely foundation
<pb facs="tcp:56286:176"/>ſtone) yet an ignorance of the time, or a falling ſhort of the true mind of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſuch or ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular phraſe, or in ſuch or ſuch terms it uſeth, which though it cauſe not a total, yet may occaſion a partial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; Or if neither of theſe, yet an adding, or mixing even in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> ſomewhat of mans with the mind of God, which kind of deception attends as well the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of other Scriptures, as thoſe which are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical; yet have I publiſhed nothing without ſuch grounds as I ſuppoſe will, even in the eye of an Adverſary (if throughly weighed) be judged ſufficient to build a conjecture upon: And poſſibly, another upon the like grounds, might be as incident to a miſtake of this nature, ſhould the event ſo prove it, as my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yet that I may not any way for the ſake of my own name, diſown, or <hi>expoſe</hi> to <hi>diſadvantage the bleſſed Truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which muſt and ſhall live, when the names of men ſhall rot; I ſhall be bold concerning this Diſcourſe humbly to ſay, <hi>That I am verily perſwaded, that as to the ſubſtance hereof, there is more in it than barely my private conjecture:</hi> And although this <hi>bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And truly ſince I compoſed the ſame, and ſaw that <hi>a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time waiting</hi> would either <hi>prove the things aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb facs="tcp:56286:176"/>to be falſe;</hi> Or <hi>if true,</hi> bring them forth with a <hi>more general acceptation, and conviction of the Truth</hi> thereof, than I either now do, or can expect it ſhould meet with, I judged it a point of prudence to forbear a while this enterprize: But two conſiderations at preſent are upon me, which over-ballance my reſolutions the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A perſwaſion</hi> (ſome part of my grounds for which are offered in the Diſcourſe it ſelf) <hi>that a very cloudy day is to befall the Church of Chriſt under the Vial we at this day ſtand under;</hi> ſome <hi>ſhadowings</hi> of which <hi>cloud</hi> (though not the diſmal ſtorm it ſends forth) will even reach us here in <hi>England,</hi> either in one way, or another: to which <hi>perſwaſion</hi> I have likewiſe, and that from ſome ground, this <hi>conſideration added,</hi> That God hath a ſpecial deſign (to the end the faith of his people might not wholly fail them in this day) upon the brink or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, to let out ſuch a light, as to the great things he is doing in the world, as ſhall wonderfully ſupport the hearts of a remnant of his people, and that quite through it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That the very thing which ſhall ſet on foot that glorious work of Chriſt againſt Antichriſt</hi> (which is the principal part or the ſubject of this diſcourſe) <hi>ſhall be a letting out of light into the world, a little before the time comes that the work is to be ſet on foot.</hi> Hence <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.1. immediately before the ruin of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the principal leading cauſe thereto, the <hi>Earth</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was <hi>covered</hi> with <hi>darkneſs</hi> as to the glorious deſigns of God, as touching his work in the world, is upon <hi>the ſudden enlightned,</hi> and what is the iſſue hereof? why, <hi>a ſpeedy and irreſiſtable judgement upon</hi> Babylon, as the whole Chapter ſhews us.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> have made me think, that as the
<pb facs="tcp:56286:177"/>people of God cannot in any way perform <hi>a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> peece of ſervice to the Lord Jeſus in this day, than by giving forth <hi>that light,</hi> the Lord either doth or ſhall give them; ſo likewiſe can they not in <hi>any work</hi> they ſhall put their hand unto, do Antichriſt <hi>a greater miſchief</hi> (next to his deſtruction it ſelf) than they may in this.</p>
                     <p>The Author acknowledgeth himſelf altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the firſt, unfit and unable every way in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſecond; yet willingly would, to the meaſure of his Talent, be found in both.

                        <p>There is a general <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which the people of God <hi>in all ages</hi> give for Chriſt againſt the World, Sin, Satan, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that <hi>teſtimony</hi> barely doth not <hi>bring him</hi> who bears it within the <hi>number</hi> of theſe <hi>two Witneſſes.</hi> A <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in his place, may <hi>oppoſe</hi> Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a <hi>Miniſter</hi> in his, error, and falſe Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and yet <hi>neither</hi> of them <hi>Chriſts two Witneſſes,</hi> if there be <hi>not</hi> in <hi>both</hi> an <hi>oppoſing themſelves</hi> to that <hi>ſpecial evill,</hi> whether it be in things <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> that was at <hi>firſt</hi> brought in, or being brought in is upheld by the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> for the <hi>peculiar work</hi> of theſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and the thing wherein lies the <hi>ſpecifical</hi> difference betwixt theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> is, <hi>That theſe bear witneſs for Christ againſt the Beast.</hi> Which is moſt evident,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Chriſt hath paired his Witneſſes in the ſame manner as the Beaſt hath his. The <hi>Beaſt</hi> (as but now I

                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Its for this Reaſon Chriſt entitles them <hi>my</hi> Witneſſes—becauſe in <hi>Chriſts behalf</hi> they ſhall <hi>ſtand up</hi> againſt <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> as thoſe are ſaid to be ſuch a mans witneſſes, that bear witneſs for him againſt his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 Which is the principal Reaſon, <hi>becauſe</hi> the time that theſe Witneſſes bear their witneſs, is the very time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> reign. The time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> reign, and treading under foot the Holy City, is Forty two months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5, Chap. 11.2.

                        <p>Now that the Forty two <hi>months,</hi> and the One thouſand two hundred and ſixty <hi>days</hi> are <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> I <hi>prove,</hi> not onely from the <hi>general conſent of Expoſitors,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the thing, giving this <hi>reaſon</hi> for it, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>forty two mouths reduced into days, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning thirty days to each month, which is the Grecian account, which</hi> John <hi>writing to the Church of GOD then reſident among the Greeks did obſerve, make up the full ſum of One thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, not a day over or under.</hi> But I prove it hence, that indeed this thing muſt needs be ſo; for let it be <hi>conſidered</hi> what is the <hi>very cauſe</hi> that theſe <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> wear <hi>ſackcloth</hi> this long term of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty <hi>years,</hi>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56286:179"/>the <hi>cauſe</hi> is, not the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> thoughout this time, for had that been the <hi>cauſe,</hi> then <hi>ſhould</hi> theſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> have <hi>put on</hi> their <hi>ſackeloth</hi> more <hi>early, viz.</hi> with the time of the ten firſt Perſecutions, which was a day of as ſore ſufferings as ever any hath been ſince, but then theſe <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> here mentioned were <hi>not</hi> in their <hi>ſackcloth;</hi> but contrariwiſe, the <hi>Woman</hi> all that time was <hi>cloathed with the Sun,</hi> Chap. 12.1. the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> therefore were not then up: But the <hi>cauſe,</hi> yea, the very cauſe <hi>why</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> wear <hi>mourning attire,</hi> is, <hi>becauſe they hear the continual Blaſphemies of the Beaſt againſt God, his name and Tabernacle, and them that dwel in Heaven:</hi> They ſee the <hi>Holy City,</hi> the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt trodden under foot</hi> by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and they not able to <hi>reſcue</hi> them out of his hands, <hi>this</hi> makes them <hi>put on ſackcloth,</hi> and mourn before the Lord. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the <hi>term of time</hi> that is <hi>given</hi> to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do theſe things, is forty two <hi>months;</hi> this being ſo, it will follow, that in caſe this forty two <hi>months</hi> were a time either longer or ſhorter than the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty <hi>days;</hi> then muſt alſo the <hi>witneſſes</hi> wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſackcloth</hi> be by ſo much <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>ſhorter</hi> then 1260 <hi>days:</hi> for continue the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and we continue the <hi>effect</hi> alſo; and contrariwiſe, take away the cauſe, and the effect ceaſeth.</p>
                        <p>Upon this <hi>Principle,</hi> it being a thing manifeſtly clear that the 42 <hi>months,</hi> the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> make up but one and the ſame number of years, which alſo muſt of neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end together; Hence it is evident, that <hi>that very act,</hi> which I may call the <hi>conſtitutive act,</hi> i. e. the act which makes theſe Witneſſes to be ſuch, is <hi>bearing witneſs against the Beaſt;</hi> take this away, though they may ſtand up againſt all the evill that is in the world beſides, yet are they not <hi>Chriſts Witneſſes,</hi> if they do not in <hi>particular</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear againſt the <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> for if this be not the meaning, what reaſon is or can be given, why their <hi>witneſs-Bearing</hi>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56286:180"/>ſhould be thus reſtrained onely to the time of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> ſeeing in the other ſenſe its a duty in all ages to bear witneſs, and thoſe Inſtruments the Lord hath raiſed up in all ages have done it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Hence a man may be a <hi>godly man,</hi> and in a more <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way</hi> bear witneſs for Chriſt, and yet <hi>none</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Two Witneſſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hence its of more <hi>concernment</hi> than many are aware of, to be <hi>inquiring into,</hi> and publickly <hi>appearing againſt</hi> whatſoever is of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> though the thing be never ſo ſmall. A man in publick place may ceaſe to be a witneſs of Chriſt, if publickly he do not bear witneſs againſt theſe things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Hence, ſuch <hi>Laws, Principles,</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> as tend to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> this witneſs-bearing againſt the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> are themſelves expreſſely <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Concluſions</hi> themſelves are theſe:</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>CONCLUSION, That the killing of the Witneſſes ſhall be in that very three years and a half, which ſhall immediately precede the Jews firſt ſtirring,</hi> which is manifeſtly clear hence, becauſe <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290 <hi>dayes</hi> which point us to the time of the <hi>Jews firſt ſtirring,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current in their <hi>end,</hi> with the <hi>end</hi> of he <hi>time, times,</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> which is the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes riſing,</hi> as ſhall be made appear in our following Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To this agrees what I have formerly written upon the Vials. The <hi>riſe</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> I have there ſtated under the <hi>fourth Vial.</hi> The <hi>drying</hi> up of the Turkiſh <hi>Powers,</hi> thereby to <hi>inſtate</hi> the Jews in their <hi>own Land</hi> under the <hi>Sixth.</hi> Now as the <hi>first ſtirring</hi> of the Jews muſt needs be ſome <hi>little time</hi> before the <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> is poured out, becauſe their <hi>ſtirring</hi> is (as I have ſhewed) the <hi>chief moving cauſe</hi> to the <hi>Gentile Saints</hi> to <hi>engage</hi> in this <hi>War</hi> againſt the Turk: So alſo it is obſervable, that the <hi>time</hi> from the <hi>Witneſſes riſe</hi> until the <hi>pouring out</hi> of the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> ſhall be but a very <hi>little time,</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth Vials</hi> being both to be poured out in an <hi>inſtant</hi> upon the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as may be ſeen with the reaſons thereof in our Diſcourſe upon the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> Hence, in regard the <hi>firſt ſtirring</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt of neceſſity be <hi>before</hi> the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> as the <hi>cauſe</hi> is before the <hi>effect,</hi> and the <hi>time</hi> betwixt the <hi>Witneſſes riſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> is ſo <hi>ſhort,</hi> we may very
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56286:183"/>well conclude, that the <hi>firſt</hi> workings among the <hi>Jews themſelves</hi> in a way of <hi>ſtirring,</hi> will be <hi>upwards,</hi> even as <hi>high</hi> as the time of the <hi>Witneſſes reſurrection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for this reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall about the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Romes ruine</hi> (which falls in the middle time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fourth and ſixth Vials) be <hi>ſtirring,</hi> are the <hi>praiſes</hi> rendred for <hi>Romes fall</hi> (as is Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> conjecture) expreſſed by an Hebrew word, <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> Revel. 19.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION, That the killing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhall be but a little before the downfal of</hi> Rome, which therefore preſently <hi>falls</hi> upon their <hi>riſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, The <hi>Order of the Vials</hi> proves this, for under the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes riſe,</hi> as upon the Vials I have ſhewed. This <hi>Vial</hi> is poured out in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> and therefore ſaid to be <hi>in an hour; In the ſame hour the tenth part of the City fell,</hi> Rev. 11.13. that is, <hi>Germany,</hi> one of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and the <hi>very place</hi> (as ſhall appear by and by) where the <hi>Witneſſes lye dead,</hi> is upon their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> in an <hi>inſtant broken off,</hi> from being any longer a <hi>Horn</hi> in Antichriſts Kingdome; and then as the <hi>next</hi> thing, and that in an <hi>inſtant</hi> too, is <hi>Rome ruined,</hi> by the pouring out of the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> So that <hi>Romes ruine</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>preſently</hi> upon the <hi>riſe</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> their <hi>killing</hi> muſt be but a <hi>little</hi> before it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This is further clear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. where wee have the <hi>proud Whore</hi> inſtantly before her downfal glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> What is the <hi>cauſe</hi> hereof? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Undoubtedly the very <hi>ſame</hi> with the <hi>cauſe</hi> of that <hi>joy</hi> and triumph of the <hi>Papals,</hi> which is expreſſed by making <hi>merry,</hi> ſending <hi>gifts</hi> one to another, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. And what was that, but the <hi>death of the Witneſſes?</hi> as the Text tells us.

                        </p>
                        <p>And that the <hi>killing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhould be here <hi>noted,</hi> is yet more clear, if we conſider, how that as thoſe <hi>words</hi> are ſpoken in the <hi>preſent tenſe,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot</hi> relate to former <hi>paſt boaſtings,</hi> ſo do they admirably <hi>agree</hi> in point of <hi>time</hi> to the <hi>killing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> for that (as I have ſaid) is to be in the very laſt <hi>three days and a half</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Tyranny, and the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> wearing Sackcloth, which <hi>time</hi> is no ſooner <hi>expired,</hi> but, as one of the firſt things, <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>ruined;</hi> accordingly this boaſt is <hi>immediately</hi> before <hi>Romes ruine.</hi> And therefore obſerve the <hi>words</hi> themſelves, and you ſhall find, that even whilſt the Whore is in this jolly fit, inſtantly and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly comes her ruine upon her, and the downfal of <hi>Rome</hi> her chief City, Rev. 18.8. <hi>Therefore ſhal her plagues come upon her in one day, death, and mourning, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her;</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>For in one hour is thy judgement come.</hi> So Verſ. 17.19. <hi>One day, one hour,</hi> that is from the <hi>time</hi> of her <hi>glorying,</hi> whilſt ſhe is thus <hi>glorying</hi> over the <hi>dead Wineſſes,</hi> up ſtart the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> down <hi>falls Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION, That the killing of the Witneſſes ſhall be in the latter end of the third Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Two things proved make this Concluſion firm.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That ſome Vials ſhall be poured out before the ſlaughter of the Witneſſes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the Vials poured out, ſhall be only the three firſt.</p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56286:184"/>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe is <hi>ſufficiently proved</hi> by Mr. <hi>Woodcock</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the two Witneſſes,</hi> p. 20 21, 22, 23. I ſhal not here repeat his Arguments, but refer the Roader to the Author himſelf, with adding this farther word, that <hi>John</hi> being, by <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> which had the 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> carried away into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> there to have the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> is to me a manifeſt <hi>Argument,</hi> that <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>poured out</hi> whilſt yet the <hi>Woman</hi> remains in the <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> why elſe ſhould the <hi>Angel</hi> of one of the <hi>Vials</hi> carry <hi>John</hi> into the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> there to <hi>learn</hi> the <hi>meaning</hi> of this <hi>myſtery,</hi> if the true <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, to whom he <hi>reveals</hi> theſe <hi>ſecrets,</hi> were not, and that even in the <hi>time</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Vials,</hi> abiding there? Yea let me adde (which will ſomething more help us) that I conceive this <hi>Angel</hi> to be <hi>no other</hi> but the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>third Vial;</hi> my reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> which is the thing <hi>revealed</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 17. Chap. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begins with the <hi>third Vial,</hi> for the <hi>firſt</hi> thing after the <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Whore</hi> her ſelf, which is to be judged, that relates to her judgement, is the <hi>Lambs overcoming</hi> ſome of the <hi>Horns,</hi> verſ. 14. which act is to be referred to the <hi>third Vial,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew preſently. And indeed the reaſon why in the <hi>explication</hi> of the Vials, the <hi>two firſt</hi> are left out, and the <hi>Angel</hi> begins with the <hi>third,</hi> is, becauſe (as I have obſerved upon the <hi>Viols,</hi> p. 260, 261, 262.) Chriſt in the <hi>two firſt Vials</hi> is but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining</hi> his own, not yet <hi>invading</hi> his Enemies Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, till the <hi>third:</hi> Now becauſe all that <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> hath ſhewed him, is <hi>only</hi> the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Whore,</hi> which (as I have ſaid) are firſt deſcribed, then their judgement peece by peece declared; therefore the <hi>two firſt Vials</hi> are omitted, as being another thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I ſay) Chriſts getting his own, then as yet judging his Enemy, and he <hi>begins</hi> with the third, where the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> of the <hi>Where,</hi> the work of breaking the <hi>Great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56286:185"/>Image,</hi> caſting down the <hi>Thrones</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> begins.</p>
                        <p>This being ſo, as it teacheth us that the diſcovering-time of the <hi>Great Whore</hi> in her true Colours, and the judgements o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>

                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the <hi>particular acts</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>preceding</hi> their <hi>killing</hi> (which killing therefore is recorded in the next verſe after theſe acts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.6, 7.) ſeem to me to have a <hi>peculiar look</hi> unto the <hi>three firſt Vials,</hi> agreeing with them moſt exactly (according to that interpretation I gave of them, whilſt yet I had no ſuch thing in mine eye) both in their ſubjects and effects alſo. As let us compare each with other.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The <hi>ſubject</hi> of the <hi>firſt Vial</hi> is the <hi>Popiſh Earth;</hi> the <hi>effect,</hi> an <hi>infectious ſore;</hi> accordingly the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to <hi>ſmite the Earth,</hi> and that with <hi>plagues,</hi> or <hi>infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſores,</hi> as often as they will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſubject</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Vial</hi> is the <hi>Popiſh Sea, i.e.</hi> the Romiſh Eccleſiaſtical, or Church-State: The <hi>effect</hi> of it, a <hi>diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> to be <hi>corrupt and mortal;</hi> accordingly the <hi>witneſſes have a power to ſhut Heaven that it rain not,</hi> that is, they ſhall make it appear, that the Antichriſtian Heaven, or Church-State (ſo much boaſted of as being the only Church) is a dry barren Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, affording no rain, to give life or nouriſhment to thoſe that live under it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſubject</hi> of the <hi>third Vial</hi> is the <hi>Rivers and fountains of waters;</hi> the <hi>effect,</hi> they become <hi>blood;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the <hi>witneſſes have a power to turn waters into blood.</hi> Now theſe <hi>acts</hi> performed by the <hi>witneſſes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before their <hi>killing,</hi> agreeing ſo <hi>fully</hi> to the <hi>three firſt Vials</hi> in their <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> both; undoubtedly we are not to look upon this admirable <hi>Harmony,</hi> to be a thing falling by <hi>accident</hi> (eſpecially conſidering too, that by theſe acts the <hi>witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to torment the Papals,

                        <p>This Obſervation confirms me in two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That in <hi>ſtating our ſelves</hi> (in my diſcourſe on the Vials) <hi>to be at this perſent time under the third Vial, I was led to ſtate the thing aright.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 That <hi>the judgement there made of the ſubjects and effects of the three firſt Vials is truth,</hi> by reaſon of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerableneſs of the <hi>Vials,</hi> according to that interpretation, to the <hi>acts</hi> of the witneſſes immediately preceding the time of their ſlaughter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>ſlaughter</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> is to <hi>fall</hi> in the <hi>interval</hi> betwixt the <hi>War of the Lamb with the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 17.14. and the <hi>ruin of Rome.</hi> This <hi>war</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> is a <hi>Civil war,</hi> a <hi>war</hi> made by a <hi>Civil ſword,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>war</hi> made with the <hi>Beaſts ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power,</hi> namely, <hi>his horns;</hi> And ſecondly, It is a <hi>Civil Power,</hi> namely, ſome of the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> that are <hi>vanquiſhed</hi> by this war, <hi>He ſhall overcome them</hi>— that is, <hi>ſuch</hi> of the <hi>ten horns,</hi> or Kings, as ſhall <hi>war</hi> againſt him, (the whole, or all the ten horns being here put for a part) and for this reaſon.

                        <p>Now this <hi>war</hi> muſt by all circumſtances be a war <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vials.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Its the <hi>Angel</hi> of one of the <hi>Vials</hi> that <hi>ſhews</hi> it unto <hi>John,</hi> ver. 1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Chriſt hath ſo many <hi>choſen ones</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in this <hi>war,</hi> which is an <hi>Argument</hi> that Chriſt had <hi>many</hi> in the world at this day who had got the <hi>victory</hi>

                        <p>It being ſo, this <hi>war</hi> can belong to no other but the <hi>Third Vial,</hi> the <hi>ſubject</hi> of which, I have ſhewed upon the <hi>Vials</hi> is ſome <hi>particular States and Kingdoms ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Beaſt,</hi> i.e. ſome of the <hi>ten horns,</hi> whoſe <hi>Heads, Rulers, &amp;c,</hi> fall by the pouring forth of that <hi>Vial.</hi> Nay it muſt be ſo, becauſe (as I have ſaid before) this is the <hi>firſt thing</hi> revealed to <hi>John</hi> as touching the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>judgement</hi> (in the <hi>explication</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi>) begins with the <hi>Third Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now obſerve in the <hi>interval</hi> betwixt this <hi>war</hi> and <hi>Romes deſtruction,</hi> we have the <hi>proud Whore</hi> brought in glorying Chap. 18.7. <hi>I ſit as a Queen,</hi> &amp;c. and what's the <hi>cauſe</hi> hereof, but onely the <hi>Victory</hi> obtained now, in the <hi>concluding time</hi> of her Kingdom, over the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> as we have already noted. I therefore conclude, <hi>the ſlaughter of the witneſſes muſt fall in this interval.</hi> If in this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,</hi> then muſt it be in the latter end of the <hi>Third Vial;</hi> for upon the pouring out of the <hi>Fourth</hi> they <hi>riſe;</hi> yea, the <hi>Fourth Vial</hi> being to fall upon <hi>Germany</hi> (as in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vials I have ſhewed) and <hi>Germany</hi> being (as ſhall appear) the <hi>place</hi> in which the <hi>witneſſes lie dead,</hi> it cannot be thought that the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſhould or can come under the <hi>fourth Vial;</hi> for how improper, yea abſurd would it be to ſay, Chriſts <hi>witneſſes</hi> by the power of the <hi>Beaſt lye dead in Germany,</hi> even whilſt Chriſt by his people is pouring out a <hi>Vial</hi> of wrath upon it?

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Upon the <hi>ſeventh Angels</hi> ſounding, <hi>the Kingdome of this world are all ſubject to Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.15. now the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56286:187"/>doing of this is the <hi>proper and peculiar work</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> as our diſcourſe on that Vial proveth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſeventh Angels</hi> ſounding, is the <hi>time of reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints,</hi> not <hi>ſome</hi> onely, but <hi>all</hi> of them, ſmall and great, <hi>ver:</hi> 18. this comes under none of the Vials but the <hi>ſeventh onely,</hi> which comprehends within it the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of rewarding the <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Saints.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Upon the <hi>ſeventh Angels</hi> ſounding there <hi>are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and voyces, and thundrings, and an earthquake, and great hail,</hi> ver. 19.

Therefore I ſay the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> is <hi>contemporary</hi> with the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> and no other. The matter of the Objection is therefore a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 For the <hi>ground</hi> of it, which lyes in theſe words, <hi>Thy wrath is come.</hi>

Hence (which confirms our ſenſe) the day of the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> (which is all one with the Battel of <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon</hi>) is called the <hi>day of Chriſts wrath,</hi> Pſal. 110.5. <hi>The fierceneſs of the wrath of Almighty God,</hi> Revel. 19.15. <hi>The day of vengeance,</hi> Iſa. 63.4. <hi>Of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> chap. 66.14. <hi>The great and terrible day of the Lord,</hi> Joel. 2.31. Mal. 4.5. all confirming this, that this <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful time</hi> of the <hi>Lambs wrath</hi> doth more properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>laſt Vial</hi> onely, than to <hi>all the Vials</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                        <p>From all the three former <hi>Concluſions</hi> put together, I make up this, <hi>viz. That the day of the Witneſſes killing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56286:188"/>muſt in all likelihood be already begun, and not much more than begun.</hi> For ſith from our firſt Concluſion, their <hi>riſe</hi> muſt be <hi>concurrent</hi> with the end of <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290 <hi>days,</hi> which beginning from <hi>Julians</hi> time, expire <hi>A.D.</hi> 1656. as ſee <hi>Generation work,</hi> part 1. p. 51, 52, 53, 54. And ſith from our ſecond Concluſion, their <hi>killing</hi> muſt be a little before <hi>Romes ruin,</hi> which (for what I have ſaid under our firſt) doth in a manner <hi>contemporiſe</hi> with the <hi>other.</hi> And ſith from our third Concluſion, their <hi>killing</hi> muſt be under the <hi>Third Vial,</hi> which is manifeſt from our diſcourſe upon the Vials, to be the Vial we ſtand under at <hi>preſent.</hi> I therefore from the whole conclude, That this black day is in all probability begun, and the Witneſſes do at this preſent time lye dead.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is a thing we muſt expect, that yet a <hi>little while,</hi> until this <hi>cloud</hi> is toward blowing over, the <hi>work of Chriſt</hi> in the world wil go on but <hi>heavily,</hi> for there is reaſon for it (as I ſhall ſhew anon) that within the <hi>day</hi> the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> lye <hi>dead,</hi> though their <hi>killing</hi> be a <hi>particular act,</hi> an act reſtrained to one place onely, yet that the <hi>work</hi> and cauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in general, ſhould the greateſt part of that day labour under a Cloud.</p>

                        <p>And farther let me ſay, Though the <hi>Saints</hi> there at this day ſeem to have <hi>loſt</hi> that <hi>noble ſpirit</hi> that was in their <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> who for Chriſts ſake loved not their lives unto death; yet ſurely, this conſideration, That they are the Children and Off-ſpring of thoſe famous bleſſed <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> who with undaunted reſolution appeared for Chriſt, when our Fore-fathers, yea, and the whole world wondered after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſhould not a little draw out the Bowels of our compaſſion towards them.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding what I have ſaid of <hi>Germany</hi> as the place, yet let me add this in the concluſion, that I conceive withall, that <hi>the condition of the people of God in other places, will not be ſo proſperous, but a cloud will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, their comforts and expectations, a great part, if not the greateſt of this time;</hi> for though the <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>blackneſs</hi> of this <hi>cloud</hi> is to hang over <hi>Germany,</hi> yet may it not be thought, but that ſo <hi>great a cloud</hi> will caſt a <hi>ſhadow</hi> further, and thereby <hi>afflict,</hi> at the ſame <hi>time,</hi> though not in the ſame <hi>meaſure,</hi> the people of God elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                        <p>And indeed, it is very reaſonable to think it ſhould be ſo; for if when but a member ſuffers in the natural body, all the members ſuffer with it; then ſurely, when not a member onely but a principal part of the myſtical Body lies under ſo fore a preſſure as the body of Chriſt never before lay under, cannot we think the other members ſhould at that time have ſuch cauſe of rejoycing, as thoſe who feel no ſmart at all. How could there then be a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in the myſtical body?</p>
                        <p>Nay, it is not onely reaſonable, but a thing of great concernment, and ſpecial uſe it ſhould be ſo; to the end, the other members by feeling ſmart and anguiſh, from a few onely of the ſcattered drops lighting upon them, might hereby be made the more ſenſible of the condition of their fellow brethren, who lie under the furious rage of the tempeſt; and alſo might from hence be ſtirred up to cry aloud to the Father of Mercies, for their poor Brethren, who now being thunder-ſtruck, have for the preſent neither ſenſe, nor life in a manner, and ſo cannot cry for themſelves.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall therefore onely offer to conſideration my own thoughts hereof, <hi>viz.

And as her boaſting ſeems to argue, this general peace ſhould not be till towards the end of the <hi>three days and a half,</hi> for this boaſting of hers is the <hi>immediate fore-runner</hi> of her ruin, which comes in upon her inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, upon the <hi>witneſſes riſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to this its not improper to add the opinion of that eminent Servant of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> in <hi>his Perſonal Reign,</hi> Printed <hi>A.D.</hi> 1642. who ſpeaking of the ten horns giving up their power to the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12, 13, 17. ſaith thus, <q>
                              <hi>Here is a double giving up of their power to the Beaſt spoken of, though yet they may ſeem both
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56286:193"/>one, but will be found of him who ponders them, at two diverſe and ſeveral times. For in the former its onely ſaid they had one mind to give their power to the Beaſt;</hi> i.e. (ſaith he) <hi>they were at that time, all alike ignorant and ſuperſtitious, and ſo the Papacy eaſily devoured them: But in the latter place its ſaid, God put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their minds to agree, and do it,</hi> i.e. <hi>at this time they were not all alike, ſome of the Kingdoms had light and reformation, and had withdrawn from</hi> Rome; <hi>yet by ſome special over-ruling Providence (in reſpect of which its ſaid, God put it into their hearts, they who had depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Popery, ſhall revolt and by ſome agreement or Covenant with the reſt, all joyntly ſhal again give up their power to the Beaſt. So that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this act differs much from the former, and ſeems to be a ſecond act of the ten Kings that is, of ſo many of them as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Papacy; and it alſo appears to be ſo, becauſe it is made the fore-runner, and the immediate fore-goer of</hi> Romes <hi>ruin, but the former giving up was at the beginning of the Papacy.</hi>
                           </q> Hitherto the very words of Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> that eminent Witneſs of Chriſt, who for the teſtimony of Jeſus, dyed in Exile fourteen or fifteen years ago, <hi>Perſ. Reign,</hi> p. 50, 51.</p>
                        <p>Now this teſtimony is the more remarkable, as to us at this day, by how much the <hi>giving-up,</hi> verſ. 17. (which he comments upon) followes that <hi>remarkable war</hi> betwixt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the <hi>Kings of the Earth,</hi> which our eies have ſeen, but the worthy Author lived not to ſee it. Yet let me add this, that I do not conceive with the Author, that this <hi>giving up of power</hi> to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſhall be a <hi>revolting of all the ten Horns</hi> to Popiſh Religion, for the <hi>power</hi> here ſpoken of, that is <hi>given up</hi> to the Beaſt, is <hi>civil power</hi> only (that being properly the power of the horns) which by way of League or Covenant with the Beaſt, or thoſe who are conſederate with him, may be given up to him, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56286:194"/>yet no receiving nor embracing Romiſh Religion.</p>
                        <p>From theſe grounds it is a thing conjectural, that a <hi>general peace ſhall be in that part of the world, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Chriſtendom, within the time of the three days and an half.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My firſt thoughts hereof were, whilſt I conſidered this 11 Chapter onely, that this peace ſhould be ſo general, as to take in all thoſe Nations that were formerly under the power of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> but ſince the time I weighed, and compared with the truth of this Chapter, the truth laid down in the 12, and 14 Chapt. it hath been a Queſtion with me, whether that people whom the Holy Ghoſt ſets forth by that Title of the <hi>remnant of the womans ſeed,</hi> Revel. 12.17. ſhall not be excluded from this agreement. One of theſe two (I ſuppoſe) we may conclude upon, that either they <hi>ſhall be excluded,</hi> or ſhall <hi>renounce</hi> this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Hell, before the <hi>three days and a half</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly <hi>expired;</hi> for the Dragon at the end of the three days and a half makes war upon them. Which of theſe two will be, time will determine; but being more and more perſwaded every day, that Chriſt is coming on upon his people apace, I ſhall not cauſe this little Book to wait to ſee the iſſue.</p>

                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> It will be here worth our inquiry, Whether this Noble Heroick Spirit ſhall come upon them from God immediately, or whether it ſhall be wrought in them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by ſome means.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I conceive, that look as the <hi>killing</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> is partly <hi>mediate,</hi> being cauſed by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> partly <hi>immediate,</hi> being deſerted by God: ſo ſhall their <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> alſo, that it may <hi>anſwer</hi> to their <hi>death,</hi> be; <hi>i.e.</hi> this <hi>Spirit of Life</hi> which ſets them upon their feet ſhall be wrought in them, <hi>partly mediately,</hi> by ſome means that ſhall be uſed to that end, and <hi>partly immediately,</hi> by Gods accompanying thoſe means with a more than ordinary power and efficacy, for the effecting this glorious work. So that Gods hand ſhall be much more viſible in the thing, than the means it ſelf, though yet means ſhall be uſed.</p>
                        <p>Now as for the means, I apprehend it ſhall be ſome <hi>loud call</hi> that ſhall be given to the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> from <hi>ſome Saints,</hi> from out of ſome other place, who ſhal be very <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of their condition, and ſhall have it ſtrongly ſet home upon their hearts, that the <hi>time</hi> is comein which they are to <hi>ariſe.</hi> This Call ſeems to me, to be that <hi>great voyce from Heaven,</hi> which bids the <hi>witneſſes come up hither,</hi> ver. 12.</p>
                        <p>Now the reaſons why this <hi>voyce from Heaven</hi> is brought in <hi>after</hi> their ſtanding upon their feet, and not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> may be theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the <hi>immediate hand of God</hi> in putting life and courage into the <hi>witneſſes</hi> to anſwer their <hi>Call,</hi> ſhall be a thing (as I have ſaid) <hi>much more</hi> remarkable and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible than the <hi>Call;</hi> and therefore is that named <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>whole</hi> of their <hi>reſurrection</hi> ſeemingly <hi>attributed</hi> therunto.</p>
                        <p>Or 2 Becauſe (which I rather judge) it is very likely that the <hi>call given them</hi> ſhall be a <hi>continued call,</hi> not a

                           <hi>call</hi> to riſe onely, but <hi>a call</hi> to ſome <hi>higher work,</hi> which <hi>work</hi> is here ſet forth by the <hi>phraſe</hi> of <hi>aſcending up to Heaven;</hi> which notes thus much to me, that the <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> who ſhall give the Witneſſes this <hi>call,</hi> being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a more <hi>refined</hi> people, in which reſpect their <hi>voyce</hi> is called a <hi>voyce from Heaven,</hi> they ſhall not onely <hi>call</hi> upon the Witneſſes to ariſe, but when they are up, follow them ſtill with their <hi>call</hi> to come up <hi>higher,</hi> into that ſtate they themſelves are in, therefore they ſay, <hi>Come up higher,</hi> i.e. ſhake off all Antichriſtian defilements, worldly intereſts, as you have ſeen us do: and now let us be no longer <hi>two,</hi> but joyn as <hi>one</hi> to ruin <hi>the Where,</hi> and carry on the work of Chriſt in the world.

Chapter likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>This 12. Chapter is on all hands interpreted to be a <hi>Prophecy of the ſtate of the Church, within the time of the Dragons rule,</hi> or <hi>the time before the riſe of the Beaſt,</hi> and accordingly the things here fore-told, are judged to have their compleat accompliſhment within the firſt 400 <hi>years</hi> after Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſs, when I conſider how handſomely, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>opinion,</hi> we have the whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> from the time <hi>John</hi> wrote, even unto the time of Chriſts ſecond coming, conſiſting of three diſtinct pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, comprized within three Chapters, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 The <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church within the <hi>firſt period,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Dragons</hi> rule, Chap. 12.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church within the <hi>ſecond period,</hi> under the Government of the <hi>Beaſt, Chap.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church, under the <hi>witneſſes riſen,</hi> from the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> reign, untill the time of Chriſts
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56286:196"/>Second coming (where begins a fourth Period, <hi>viz.</hi> of the 1000 years) <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>I am by this ſingle conſideration more inclined to be of the common opinion, as to this 12 Chapter, then by any thing that hitherto I have found laid down for the ſame, by the Authors and Aſſertors of it, who urge not this as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, not indeed can they, becauſe (as I ſhall hereafter ſhew) they make application of the 14 Chapter, not to the <hi>third Period,</hi> but another <hi>time;</hi> and as for what is commonly urged, there is nothing in it that I can obſerve, that has the force of an Argument, but what is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begged principles.</p>
                        <p>Yet muſt I alſo acknowledge, that although this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> I have now <hi>hinted,</hi> could I make it out to my ſelf, would <hi>ſway</hi> very much with me, yet hath it the leſs <hi>weight,</hi> by how much I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf, that ſuch a <hi>Tripartite doviſion</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſhould be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And my reaſon is, becauſe I find ſomething in this 12 <hi>Chapter</hi> (which is the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi>) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down even into the <hi>time of the Beaſt;</hi> for the <hi>time of the Beaſt</hi> doth, yea muſt begin with the <hi>beginning</hi> of the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> as hath been before proved, <hi>Cha.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Now ſuppoſing the <hi>time times, and a half,</hi> to be <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> to the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> yet it is <hi>clear</hi> from the <hi>Prophecie</hi> it ſelf, that ſome <hi>attempts</hi> are made by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> after <hi>the time, times, and a half</hi> are begun; As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The <hi>caſting water</hi> out of his mouth as a flood after the Woman, verſ. 15.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>attempting a war</hi> after this upon the remnant of her ſeed, verſ. 17.</p>
                        <p>Both theſe things (I ſay) are done after the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was come into the world, and therefore may not be applied to the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Dragons</hi> rule, which ceaſed upon the <hi>Beaſts</hi> coming in, he then reſigning his power, ſeat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Beaſt, Chap. 13.2. If therefore we may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56286:196"/>this <hi>Prophecy</hi> a little <hi>time</hi> downwards into the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdom, after the <hi>Dragon</hi> had ſurrendred to him, I ſee no reaſon why we may not as well <hi>extend</hi> it quite through the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdome, for the former order, yea and the common method too, is as much broken by the one, as by the other. Nor indeed can I ſee, unleſs we come down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>expiring</hi> time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdom, where a people, after the 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> were begun, will be found, that had (rightly interpreted) theſe two Characters upon them, that the <hi>remnant of the Womans ſeed,</hi> which the <hi>Dragon</hi> makes war upon, are deſcribed by.</p>
                        <p>And as theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> have gravelled me as to that <hi>opinion</hi> which makes <hi>application</hi> of the things here foretold to the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Dragons</hi> rule: So by other <hi>Conſiderations</hi> I am induced to think that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of this Chapter doth bring us down to the <hi>very end</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdom, the <hi>expiring</hi> time of the 42 <hi>months;</hi> and that indeed the laſt verſe of this Chapter, being joyned to the firſt of the fourteeenth, and ſo deſcending, we have in theſe two Chapters alone (the thirteenth being cut off) all the aforeſaid <hi>three Periods.</hi> 1 That of the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church within that Period, ſet forth in the five firſt verſes of this 12 Chap. 2 That of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> 42 <hi>months,</hi> or 1260 dayes, and the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church within that time, from verſ. 6. to the end. 3 That of the <hi>Witneſſes riſen,</hi> or the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Gentile Churches from about the time of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> riſe, until Chriſts ſecond coming, Chap. 14.</p>
                        <p>And according to this method, as this 12 Chapter, and the 14 linked together, do run <hi>parallel</hi> with the whole of the 11, which treats of the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> ſo this 12 Chapter alone runs <hi>parallel</hi> with ſo much of the 11, as brings us to the end of the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> only ſome things handled there, are omitted here; and ſome things omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there are handled here; both together making the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56286:197"/>of the <hi>Wineſſes</hi> Prophecying and Killing-time coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                        <p>And farther, as ſo much of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the 11 Chapter, as refers to the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> joyned to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this 12, makes the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> or ſecond period, ſo far as the ſame reſpects the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> compleat; ſo that which follows in the 11 Chap. after the 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> are expired, joyned to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Chap. 14. makes the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the third Period, or the <hi>time</hi> from the <hi>Witneſſes riſe</hi> till Chriſts coming, full and compleat alſo. But now becauſe the things done throughout the ſecond Period, have a ſpecial <hi>relation</hi> as well to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> which <hi>Beaſt,</hi> though named, Chap. 11.7. and his time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance alſo ſpoken of, verſ. 2. had not been as yet particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcribed (the Holy Ghoſt hitherto having been chiefly intent to ſet forth the condition of the Witneſſes and Woman) that therefore the things concerning this <hi>Beaſt</hi> might neither be paſſed over in ſilence, nor brought in promiſcuouſly with the other, which would have bred confuſion, the Holy Ghoſt paſſing over this ground again, and being come to the end of the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> makes a breach, by diſ-joyning the 12 and 14 Chapters, to make way hereby for a deſcription of that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which in a more ſecret manner acted by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> ſhould rage and make war againſt the Saints, cauſing them hereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Wilderneſs all the 1260 <hi>dayes;</hi> telling us what manner of <hi>Beaſt</hi> this <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould be, whence he ſhould receive his power at firſt, what he ſhould do with it, and how long. That the <hi>Dragon</hi> who was openly worſhipped before, ſhould in a more ſecret way be worſhipped ſtill under him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things, with many other particulars relating to this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> being handled, as it were, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a digreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. there is a returning again <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. to that point where the diſcourſe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56286:197"/>off, which now is carried on without interruption, to the end, and the time of Chriſts coming.</p>
                        <p>The reſult of all in brief is this; <hi>That the</hi> 12 <hi>and the</hi> 14 <hi>Chapters, are but a more full repetition of the</hi> 11, <hi>and that in theſe two Chapters joyned together</hi> (leaving out the 13.) <hi>we have all the three Periods from Johns time until Christs ſecond coming,</hi> viz. <hi>The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi> of the <hi>Dragons</hi> rule; the <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in fackcloth, or the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Wilderneſs; the <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes riſen,</hi> compleatly and orderly handled. And that the 13 <hi>Chapter</hi> is no other, but a going <hi>over again</hi> (for the clearing up another ſubject referring to this time) the <hi>ſecond Period,</hi> beinging us down the third time to that point, which twice before, once <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and again in the repetition <hi>Ch.</hi> 12. we are come unto. In a word, that the <hi>laſt verſe</hi> of the 12 <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> of the 14, are in <hi>time</hi> and <hi>order</hi> immediately to <hi>follow</hi> each other; and therefore the <hi>appearing</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> upon <hi>Mount Sion</hi> with the 144000 to be the <hi>immediate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> of, and indeed a thing cauſed by the <hi>Dragons</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a <hi>war,</hi> at the very end of the 42 <hi>months,</hi> or 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> upon that <hi>holy remiant</hi> of the Womans ſeed.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, according to this method (leaving out the 13 <hi>Chapter,</hi> which is a Prophecy more relating to the Beaſt, than the Woman) we have in the 12 and 14 <hi>Chapters</hi> excellently ſet forth the <hi>threefold ſtate</hi> of the Woman, or true Church, according to that <hi>threefold Period</hi> ſhe paſſeth through, from the time <hi>John</hi> wrote this Prophecy, until Chriſts ſecond coming. 1 We have the Woman <hi>walking in her Primitive purity,</hi> dothed with the Sun, having the Moon underfoot, on her head a Crown of twelve Stars, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1. This was the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church within the <hi>firſt Period</hi> before Antichriſt crept in. In this eſtate, ſhe is perſecuted by a <hi>Great Rod Dragon,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>i.e.</hi> by the Pagan power of the Roman Empire.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56286:198"/>2 We have the <hi>Woman in the Wilderneſs,</hi> verſ. 6. to the end. This is her <hi>ſecond ſtate,</hi> after Antichriſt was come forth, and had placed himſelf in the Temple of God, then the Woman, the true Church withdraws, retires her ſelf into a corner. In this <hi>eſtate</hi> ſhe ſuffers by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>end</hi> of it is perſecuted again by the <hi>Dragon.</hi> What this <hi>Dragon</hi> is, and how different from the former, I may ſhew hereafter. 3 We have the Woman <hi>come out of the Wilderneſs again,</hi> and triumphing, being now delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi> both, treading theſe her enemies under feet: This is her <hi>third ſtate,</hi> and is ſet forth <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. which (as I have ſaid) is but a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Womans Hiſtory, from the point of time where the 12 <hi>Chapter</hi> ends, until Chriſts coming.</p>
                        <p>This Method, as it doth not, ſo far as I am able to diſcern, infer any abſurdity; ſo doth it not a little conduce to the clearing up the whole of theſe four Chapters (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be the moſt knotty peece to carry a right Method through in this Book) yea, and many other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptical Myſteries depending upon theſe; and farther doth help us to the knowledge of ſome uſeful truths, which lye obſcured and buried through a miſtaken order.</p>
                        <p>And indeed when I conſider, That as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. preſents us with two myſtical numbers, one of 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> the other of <hi>three dayes and a half;</hi> ſo alſo doth <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. with 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> verſ. 6. and a <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> verſ. 14. how that in either Chapters betwixt theſe two <hi>times,</hi> mention is made of a <hi>War;</hi> and farther, how that as the <hi>Witneſſes, Chap.</hi> 11.9. within <hi>the three dayes and a half,</hi> have the People, Kindreds, Nations, and Tongues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friending them; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Woman, Chap.</hi> 12.16. within the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> hath the earth befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; I ſay, when I have conſidered this, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wondred that none ſhould attempt a way, to make theſe two, which carry ſo great a likelihood, to run parallel,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56286:198"/>but ſhould without any farther inquiry, conclude the 11 <hi>Chapter</hi> to bring us down to the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>the Beaſts</hi> reign, yea lower, and yet the 12 <hi>Chap.</hi> to bring us but to the <hi>beginning.</hi>

                        <p>BEſides our grounds laid down in the former Section, that which yet further prevails with me to decline the common-road, is, <hi>that I cannot upon a rational account ſatisfie my ſelf, that the time, times, and a half, ſhould be the ſame with the</hi> 1260 <hi>days;</hi> and in caſe a flaw be found here, all that is or can be ſaid for the general Tenent will amount to nothing; for if the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> be a <hi>diſtinct number,</hi> and not to be interpreted of the 1260 <hi>days;</hi> then of neceſſity cannot the things ſpoken of in this Chapter, be <hi>appliable</hi> to <hi>the time</hi> of <hi>the Dragons rule,</hi> or any <hi>time</hi> before <hi>the Beaſt</hi> aroſe; but muſt be brought down much lower, into <hi>the time</hi> of <hi>the Beaſts</hi> Kingdom.</p>

(which <hi>War</hi> (as I conceive) points at our <hi>Engliſh War,</hi> and no other) one and the ſame; but this I muſt alſo ſay, that I am more ſatisfied to look upon them as <hi>two Wars,</hi> both within the 60 <hi>years,</hi> and the one following the other; And ſo this <hi>War</hi> to be the <hi>German War</hi> only, and the other betwixt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth to be the <hi>Engliſh War,</hi> yet both to fall within the laſt 60 <hi>years,</hi> and to be forerunners of <hi>the killing</hi> of <hi>the Witneſſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Reaſons why I conceive this War to be the <hi>German War</hi> only, and not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo, are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the <hi>Engliſh War</hi> hath been betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants only, but this <hi>War</hi> is a <hi>War</hi> betwixt ſome eminent <hi>Proteſtant Head</hi> on the one ſide, and ſome <hi>eminent</hi> and profeſſed <hi>Popiſh Head</hi> on the other, as hath been before obſerved.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe this <hi>War</hi> being made by the Dragon, is not ſo fitly appliable to any one Nation under Heaven, as the <hi>German Empire,</hi> which is (as I may ſay) the very <hi>Picture</hi> of <hi>the Old Dragon,</hi> for <hi>the Dragon</hi> is ſet forth as having <hi>ſeven heads</hi> &amp; <hi>ten horns,</hi> v. 3. <hi>And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold a great red Dragon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56286:202"/>ſeven heads, and ten horns.</hi> Accordingly <hi>the German Empire</hi> (as upon another occaſion hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved) conſiſts of <hi>ſeven Electoral heads, and ten horns, i.e.</hi> ſo many Provinces. The <hi>Prophecy</hi> therefore of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> may without any forcing be applied in part to <hi>the Old Roman Empire,</hi> and alſo in part to the preſent <hi>German Empire,</hi> both of them bearing and giving the arms of the <hi>Dragon.</hi> So that by the <hi>ruine</hi> of the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> only changed his <hi>Seat,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook <hi>Rome his old Seat,</hi> leaving that to <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to <hi>Germany,</hi> where <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> for his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſurrender <hi>his old Seat</hi> to him, provides him a new. And indeed there may be theſe <hi>two Reaſons</hi> given of it, why the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who <hi>governs</hi> the whole <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> doth yet betake himſelf to <hi>Germany,</hi> rather then any <hi>other place,</hi> chooſing that for <hi>his Seat;</hi> 1 <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> of all the Nations ſubjected to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> none was found ſo like <hi>his old Seat, the Pagan Empire,</hi> as the new erected <hi>German Empire.</hi> 2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the Woman had in a manner for many ages together, taken up her dwelling there, bringing forth children, and ſending them abroad from thence into other parts, therefore this old Perſecutor of the Woman, that he might the more trouble her peace, placeth his Throne there.</p>
                        <p>What I have ſaid, is a good confirmation of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod before laid down, that this <hi>Chapter</hi> brings us to <hi>the end</hi> of <hi>the Beaſts Kingdom,</hi> and is not to be limited within the firſt <hi>four hundred yeers</hi> after Chriſt; for having ſpoken of <hi>the Old Dragon</hi> (or <hi>Roman Empire</hi>) in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the attempts that he made againſt the Woman, verſ. 3.4. and then gliding over almoſt all the time of <hi>the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> becauſe that <hi>time,</hi> as in reference to the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or Woman had been ſpoken to already, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. in reference to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> was to be ſpoken to <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56286:202"/>comes to ſpeak of the <hi>new Dragon</hi> (or German Empire) and the <hi>attempts</hi> that he in the <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>time</hi> ſhould make againſt the Woman, and alſo what ſhould follow thereupon, and ſo indeed this <hi>ſecond</hi> attempt againſt the Woman, ſpecially relates to <hi>him,</hi> as the firſt did to the <hi>old Dragon.</hi> And further obſerve, as the <hi>old Dragon</hi> about the beginning of the 1260 <hi>days</hi> is vanquiſhed by the Woman, and yet afterwards politickly ſurrendring to the Beaſt is too hard for the Woman, and makes her <hi>flie</hi> for the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> for 1260 <hi>days;</hi> So in like manner, the <hi>New Dragon</hi> about the <hi>end</hi> of the 1260 <hi>daies</hi> is vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Woman, and yet afterwards by policy (like the <hi>old Dragon</hi>) finds a way to get the maſtery of the Woman, and make her <hi>flie</hi> for the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> for a <hi>time, times, and a half;</hi> or three <hi>years and a half.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now according to this interpretation of this Prophecy, referring this ſecond attempt of <hi>the Dragon</hi> to the <hi>German Empire,</hi> we ſee already the whole of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> fulfilled to two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The <hi>Dragons attempt</hi> to ſwallow up the Woman, by caſting a flood out of his mouth, and the earth prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. being the ſame with that endeavor, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.9. to put the dead bodies of the Witneſſes into graves, and the Peoples, Kindreds, Nations and Tongues, preventing him. This attempt is clear from each place, to be within <hi>the three years and a half.</hi> Whether ſome attempts that have been made againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> not long ſince to extirpate them; and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that in their behalf have been made by ſome to the ruling powers of <hi>Germany,</hi> be a fulfilling of this Prophecy, or whether we are yet to expect ſome more eminent, and noted action than any we have hitherto ſeen, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Another <hi>attempt</hi> which ſhall be after this, and moſt probably towards the end of the <hi>three days and a half,</hi>
                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56286:203"/>viz. to make <hi>war</hi> with a <hi>remnant</hi> of the Womans ſeed, that ſhall within this <hi>time</hi> ſtand up for Chriſt in ſome other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world: But of this more anon.</p>

                           <hi>OBjection</hi> 2. Againſt our former method it may be objected. That this our <hi>opinion</hi> ſuppoſeth the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be <hi>come out</hi> of the Wilderneſs, and afterwards to <hi>go in again;</hi> and if ſo, then muſt the Womans <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> in the Wilderneſs the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond time,</hi> be <hi>upwards</hi> of <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> for ſo long ſhe was the firſt time onely, verſ. 6. and if ſo, then muſt the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts reign,</hi> his treading under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the Holy City, the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> wearing ſackcloth, (which for time are the ſame with this) be likewiſe <hi>upwards of One thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>firſt Suppoſition</hi> granted, the other indeed will neceſſarily follow; but that we deny, affirming, that the <hi>Woman</hi> is here ſpoken of, as if <hi>come out</hi> of the Wilderneſs at this time of the War in Heaven (though indeed in it) and that for one, or both theſe reaſons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Becauſe by her <hi>great victories,</hi> and ſucceſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her enemy, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> under the noble <hi>Swediſh King,</hi> ſhe ſeemed in a manner to be <hi>got out</hi> of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and to have put off her ſackcloth, and therefore is ſpoken of, as if come out, becauſe in appearance for a while ſhe was ſo, giving check to the proud Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Becauſe the time of her being in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> after this (though ſhort) yet was to be a more <hi>black and diſmal time,</hi> than all the time before, and ſhe was to meet with ſufferings of another kind than ever yet ſhe

                           <hi>OBjection</hi> 3. But it may be further objected, That the <hi>former Poſition</hi> and method makes the Apocalyptical <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> repugnant to, and irreconcilable with <hi>Daniels time, times, and a half.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>known maxim,</hi> that Scriptures more <hi>dark,</hi> are to be interpreted by Scriptures more <hi>clear.</hi> Now it being confeſſed on all hands, that <hi>Johns</hi> light is the more clear, we are therefore to make <hi>John</hi> interpretative of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and not <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>John.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Compare <hi>Daniel</hi> with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and follow this rule, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nterpret that which is more <hi>dark,</hi> by that which is more <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf ſpeaks poſitively to our Aſſertion. Thrice in <hi>Daniel</hi> we have the word <hi>time or times</hi> uſed in a <hi>myſtical ſenſe,</hi> Dan. 4.32. <hi>Seven times ſhall paſs over thee.</hi> Chap. 7.25. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill a time, times, and the dividing of time.</hi> Chap. 12.7. <hi>It ſhall be for a time, times, and a half.</hi> In the firſt of theſe we have little <hi>myſtery,</hi> but the two laſt have in them much <hi>myſtery.</hi> Now conſider, whether it is moſt likely that we ſhould interpret the <hi>two laſt places</hi> in a ſenſe different from the <hi>firſt;</hi> or whether are we to interpret them by the <hi>firſt;</hi> ſurely, it is moſt ſafe to ſay that we are to interpret them by the <hi>firſt,</hi> not only becauſe the <hi>firſt</hi> is the more <hi>clear,</hi> but alſo becauſe the <hi>firſt</hi> ſeems to me to be therefore laid down before the other, that it might be a <hi>Standard</hi> of light to guide us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in the other. If ſo, then the <hi>ſeven times</hi> that were to paſs over <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whilſt he was to eat graſs like Oxen, being no other but <hi>ſeven years,</hi> muſt we alſo underſtand the <hi>time, times,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56286:204"/>and a half,</hi> or the <hi>time, times, and dividing of time,</hi> of <hi>three years and a half,</hi> onely, as I have formerly noted,</p>
                        <p>But thirdly, To come to the places themſelves, where the bottom of this ſcruple lies, which are <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.7. I ſuppoſe, let them be throughly weighed, and it will appear, that the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> will as well, if not better, bear our ſenſe of <hi>three years and a half,</hi> then the other which interprets them <hi>one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin with <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.7. and the rather, becauſe the words there opened will help us to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in the other.</p>
                        <p>Now the Queſtion is, Whether are we to underſtand the <hi>time, times, and a half</hi> in that place, <hi>of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years,</hi> or onely of <hi>three years and a half?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, of <hi>three years and a half,</hi> and that appears upon this account. In verſ. 6. we have a Queſtion put in <hi>Daniels</hi> hearing, <hi>How long it ſhould be unto the end of Wonders?</hi> To this Queſtion we have a two-fold anſwer given; Firſt, A more <hi>dark</hi> Anſwer, verſ. 7. Secondly, A more <hi>clear</hi> Anſwer, verſ. 11, 12. And obſerve, either Anſwer conſiſts of two branches, ſuitable to the Wonders themſelves ſpoken of, which were to have a <hi>double end,</hi> or fulfilling time. Firſt, <hi>A partial.</hi> Secondly, <hi>A total,</hi> accordingly either anſwer hath (I ſay) two Branches. The firſt Anſwer, verſ. 7. hath firſt, The <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> as one Branch. Secondly, The <hi>ſcattering the power</hi> of the holy people, as another. The ſecond, verſ. 11, 12. hath, Firſt, 1290 <hi>days,</hi> as one Branch. Secondly, 1335 <hi>days,</hi> as another.</p>
                        <p>Now that the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and not things of a <hi>diverſe</hi> nature is pointed at in both theſe Anſwers, is clear.</p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56286:204"/>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe each Anſwer conſiſts (as I have ſaid) of <hi>two diſtinct Branches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> (as is clear) puts the Queſtion <hi>the ſecond time,</hi> concerning that very thing that <hi>the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> was moved about, and the very reaſon of his putting <hi>the Queſtion</hi> the <hi>ſecond time,</hi> is for more light into that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which he heard given, but did not underſtand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, verſ. 8. <hi>And I heard, but I underſtood not;</hi> and therefore puts the Queſtion again. The <hi>intent</hi> of the Queſtion therefore in both being the ſame, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is to be looked upon as the ſame alſo.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Becauſe the very <hi>words</hi> of the Lord to <hi>Daniel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives him a ſecond anſwer, import as much, for ſaith he, verſ. 9. <hi>The words are cloſed and ſealed up till the time of the end.</hi> What <hi>words?</hi> why, thoſe <hi>words Daniel</hi> asked after, the words of the former anſwer more eſpecially, for the ſealing the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> in general, we had before, verſ. 4. ſhewing plainly, that as the Queriſt, ſo the reſpondent was ſtill upon one and the ſame thing, as to ſay, The <hi>thing, O Daniel,</hi> thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt after is not to be revealed <hi>untill</hi> the time of the <hi>end;</hi> yet becauſe thou art ſo deſirous to know, thou ſhalt have it in a <hi>plainer,</hi> and more <hi>familiar</hi> Dialect, and what that is, the ſecond anſwer tells us, Verſ. 11. <hi>And from the time that the daily ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, ſhall be</hi> 1290 <hi>days,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the</hi> 1335 <hi>days.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The anſwer then being <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> in both, the thing now to be inquired into is, How or in what ſenſe can we make the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> to be one and the ſame with the 1290 <hi>days?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot make them <hi>one</hi> and the ſame in <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> ſtretched out at that length Expoſitors would have them, make but 1260 <hi>days,</hi> which falls ſhort by thirty days or years of 1290; they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56286:205"/>muſt therefore be one and the ſame in <hi>termination,</hi> either terminating and ending at one and the ſame point; If ſo, then ſuppoſe we take the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> for <hi>three years and a half</hi> onely, namely, the <hi>laſt three years and a half,</hi> of <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290, will the <hi>time, times, and a half</hi> concur with the 1290 in their <hi>end,</hi> as well as if by <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> we ſhould underſtand 1260 years; for reckon three years and a half onely, or 1260 years compleat, and make either but to end at the ſame point, with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> 1290, it amounts all to one, and the one is as good, and as firm as the other.</p>
                        <p>Nay, that the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> is rather to be underſtood in our <hi>ſenſe,</hi> viz. for <hi>three years and a half</hi> onely, than in the other, for 1260 years, ſeems to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account; becauſe the <hi>intent</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt in the firſt anſwer is, not to meaſure the <hi>length</hi> of the time, how long it ſhould be <hi>until</hi> the performance of thoſe things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made after, which is done in the ſecond anſwer; but rather to give ſome knowledge of the thing, by hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>two</hi> wonderful remarkable actions, as marks, of which <hi>two,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> ſhould fall out at the <hi>beginning</hi> time, the <hi>laſt</hi> at the <hi>compleating time</hi> of the work. The <hi>firſt mark</hi> is the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> i.e. The black day of killing the Witneſſes, which God in his all-wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had ſo ordered, and would in his time ſo bring about, as that, that black day, and the 1290 days ſhould expire together; Or thus, That the riſe of the Witneſſes at the end of the time, times, and a half, and the firſt ſtirring of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the end of 1290 years, ſhould both concur, as it were, in the ſame point, fall out much about one and the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſecond mark</hi> (which relates to the latter number, <hi>viz.</hi> of 1335. days) is the <hi>accompliſhing</hi> to ſcatter the power of the holy people; <hi>And when he ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed to ſcatter the power of the Holy people, all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56286:205"/>theſe things ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> Two things ere we can make application of this mark to the number it relates to, are neceſſary to be cleared up; 1. <hi>Who are meant by this holy people?</hi> 2. <hi>What that ſcattering is</hi> which is here ſpoken of, <hi>and by whom?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the firſt, By the <hi>holy people,</hi> we are undoubtedly to underſtand the <hi>Jews,</hi> and no other in this place, for the people whoſe deliverance <hi>Daniel</hi> is here ſo inquiſitive after, are that people of whoſe deliverance <hi>Daniel</hi> had had a promiſe made to him, verſ. 1. <hi>At that time ſhall thy people be delivered</hi>— but they were the <hi>Jews,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>thy people,</hi> i.e. <hi>Daniels</hi> people, the people of <hi>Daniels</hi> Nation.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond, <hi>This ſcattering</hi> is not to be underſtood of their <hi>preſent diſperſed condition,</hi> in which they are a people diſperſed and ſcattered by the Lord himſelf into all the corners of the earth, for in this ſtate they are not the <hi>holy people,</hi> but a people for the preſent <hi>rejected</hi> of God, therefore called by God himſelf in this ſtate <hi>Loammi, Not my people, Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. but in the ſcattering here ſpoken of, they are conſidered as the <hi>holy people,</hi> and therefore the ſcattering of them is called <hi>the ſcattering of the holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> intimating, that this ſcattering is not their ſcattering by God, whilſt they continue in their rejected ſtate; but a ſcattering by ſome other, after they come out of that ſtate, and are again the choſen people of God; and indeed, were we to interpret this ſcattering to be the act of God, then ſurely (conſidering the perſon here ſpeaking, is the Lord himſelf, as compare ver. 7. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6.) he would rather have ſpoken in the firſt perſon, when <hi>I ſhall</hi> have accompliſhed to ſcatter the power of the holy people, than in the third, when <hi>he ſhall.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>In a word therefore, as the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> which ſets forth the moſt <hi>black day of the Gentiles</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God ſo to fall out, as that it is here laid down in the more <hi>dark</hi> anſwer, as a mark of the <hi>firſt, viz.</hi> 1290 dayes, which notes the <hi>beginning time;</hi> ſo the <hi>ſcattering the power of the holy people,</hi> or the <hi>Jews black day,</hi> is laid down as a mark of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> viz. the 1335 dayes, or the <hi>compleating time</hi> of Wonders, when (as ſaith the Text) <hi>all theſe things ſhall be fulfilled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now beſides that reaſon that the thing it ſelf carries with it as I have opened it, that what hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That the intent of the Holy Ghoſt in the firſt anſwer, is not to lay down any way, or rule for us to calculate the times by, but rather to give us evident marks, and ſigns of either time, appears to me for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> as to the <hi>firſt branch</hi> of the Anſwer, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the time, times, and a half,</hi> we have no <hi>head of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> laid down where to begin them, if we begin them with the beginning of <hi>Johns</hi> 1260, they fall (as we have ſaid) thirty years too ſhort; if from the time <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56286:206"/>the Viſion, above a thouſand years too ſhort; where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall we begin them, or how ſhall we account if we cannot find a Head to begin our account upon? The Holy Ghoſt whereſoever he intends an account of times ſhould be made up by us, doth either lay down ſome expreſs <hi>Head</hi> for us to begin upon, as in the following verſes. And alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 25. or elſe leaves us to begin from the <hi>time</hi> of the Viſion, but here we have not the one, nor may we do the other.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the <hi>ſecond branch,</hi> viz. the ſcattering of the power of the holy people, is <hi>no number,</hi> and therefore can be no other thing but a mark, <hi>ergo,</hi> muſt the firſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe</hi> if the <hi>intent of the firſt anſwer</hi> be to give us any <hi>account</hi> of the time how long; then conſidering that this is the main drift of the <hi>ſecond</hi> anſwer, it will follow, that either we have <hi>two diverſe</hi> accounts laid down in the two ſeveral anſwers, or but <hi>one;</hi> if <hi>two diverſe,</hi> how then are the anſwers the <hi>ſame,</hi> which we have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; if <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> then is there <hi>Tautologie</hi> in the Text.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 And laſtly, This ſeems to me to be the very reaſon why the anſwer was ſo dark to <hi>Daniel,</hi> that he heard, but underſtood not, becauſe <hi>the force of the anſwer lay in ſigns,</hi> which being not as then things viſible, or in being, <hi>Daniel</hi> is confounded within himſelf, and knows not what to make of the anſwer.</p>
                        <p>This being ſo, that the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> are here laid down only by way of <hi>mark,</hi> it will much better agree to our ſenſe, to take the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> for <hi>three years and a half,</hi> than to the other which interprets them, 1260 <hi>years;</hi> for that which is laid down purely as a <hi>mark,</hi> muſt not be drawn out at <hi>length,</hi> for then it ceaſeth to be a <hi>mark,</hi> and becomes a <hi>rule</hi> to meaſure by, but muſt ever be held and accounted for ſome noted point,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56286:207"/>ſome remarkable action, by obſerving which we may learn ſomething elſe.</p>
                        <p>This Text being opened, there needs not much to be ſaid to that other, Chap. 7.25. ſave only, that as the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> are here laid down by way of <hi>mark;</hi> ſo likewiſe are the <hi>time, times, and dividing of time</hi> there. The thing they point at is not the <hi>duration</hi> of the little Horns Kingdom, how long it ſhould continue from the time of its firſt riſe, but rather to ſhew (which who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it ſhall find to be the very ſcope of the place) <hi>when</hi> this blaſphemous, raging little Horn, who for a long time together had worn out the Saints, changed times and Laws, ſhould have a period put to his boundleſs rage and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which (I ſay) is ſet forth, not by meaſuring the time of his Kingdom, but by hinting (as a mark) a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable action which ſhould be in the very concluding time of it, and indeed prove the break-neck of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that is the <hi>black day of the witneſſes killing,</hi> the end of which day ſhould put a period to his Kingdom, the time of his rage and tyranny; which thing, though a great myſtery in <hi>Daniel,</hi> therefore when <hi>Daniel</hi> heard this the ſecond time, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. he confeſſeth that he <hi>underſtood</hi> it not, yet it is a thing cleerly revealed in <hi>John</hi> (as we have formerly noted) <hi>viz.</hi> that the end of Antichriſts Kingdom, and the end of the three dayes and a half (the limited time of the Witneſſes lying dead) ſhall fall at one and the <hi>ſame point;</hi> and therefore well may the <hi>time, time, and dividing of time,</hi> he laid down as a <hi>mark</hi> to ſhew when a <hi>Period</hi> ſhould be put to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>little Horn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Daniels time, times, and a half,</hi> is ſo far from being <hi>repugnant</hi> to that <hi>Expoſition</hi> I have given of <hi>Johns time, times, and a half,</hi> that indeed rightly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we have hence a ſtrong <hi>confirmation</hi> of it, yea of our <hi>whole</hi> meth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d; for (as I ſaid at firſt) if <hi>Johns time, times, and a half,</hi> be not to be underſtood of 1260 years,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56286:207"/>but of <hi>three years and a half</hi> only, then of neceſſity muſt the <hi>method</hi> of this 12 <hi>Chapter</hi> be, as <hi>I have</hi> ſtated it.</p>
                        <p>If notwithſtanding all, any ſhould yet ſay, That ſurely it cannot be without ſomething of the <hi>mind of God,</hi> that a <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> that is, <hi>three years and a half</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>dayes,</hi> and theſe <hi>dayes</hi> into <hi>years</hi> again, ſhould make the very ſum of 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> or <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, I am verily perſwaded that there is much of the <hi>mind and wiſdome of God in it;</hi> but if I may nakedly ſpeak what I think is the <hi>mind of God</hi> herein, I take it to be this, That men when they will be curious (which is a thing the beſt are prone unto, and as ſoon taken with as any one ſnare I know) ſhall even in the word it ſelf find ſomething to feed their curioſity, whereby the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of truth ſhall be hidden to them. And indeed whether to go from a certain Prophetical ſtile, a time for a year, to a new ſtile, no where clearly found in all the Word, namely, a time or year put for a year of years, only upon this account, becauſe a time, times, and a half, <hi>i. e.</hi> three years and a half, will by this reduction amount to 1260 years; I ſay, whether it ſeem not to ſavour more of curioſity than truth, and might not poſſibly be by the wonderful wiſdome of God ſo left in the Word on purpoſe, that truth till the diſcovering time ſhould come, might be the more veiled; I leave to the Spiritual and underſtanding Reader to judge.</p>
                        <p>The reſult of the whole is, that the Prophecie of the twefth Chapter is not to be limited to the firſt period; but brings us down even to the end of the ſecond period, namely of the 1260 years, and conſequently the <hi>time, times, and a half;</hi> mentioned verſ. 14. is the ſame with the <hi>three dayes and a half,</hi> Chap. 11.9.</p>

                        <p>I Shall conclude this Chapter with a word or two of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, as touching this <hi>remnant</hi> of the Womans ſeed. Two things concerning them are worthy a ſearch after.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 What people are here meant by this <hi>remnant of the Womans ſeed,</hi> that the Dragon within the three days and a half makes war upon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 How, or in what fenſe we are to conceive of <hi>this War made upon this remnant</hi> of the Womans ſeed by the Dragon.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt, I ſhall not preſume to determine any thing of this people, any further than the Holy Ghoſt hath, who deſcribes them by two notable <hi>diſtinguiſhing Characters,</hi> as willing thereby to mark them out from all the people, that within the time of the three days and a half, ſhould be found in the world beſides.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>They are ſuch who keep the Commandements of God.</hi> By <hi>Commandements</hi> we are to underſtand thoſe <hi>Goſpel-Inſtitutions</hi> Chriſt gave to his people in command upon his Reſurrection, ſo called, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2. <hi>After that he through the Holy Ghoſt had given Commandements unto the Apoſtles whom he had choſen.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>Such a <hi>People,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>eminent</hi> above all others for theſe <hi>Characters,</hi> ſhall be found in the world, at the time the Witneſſes lye dead; theſe ſhall be as an eye-ſore to the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who ſhall dread ſome <hi>miſchief</hi> to ariſe to his Kingdom from them; and therefore he ſhall <hi>wonderouſly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But now as to the ſecond, How doth he attempt them, or what manner of wat is it that he makes upon them?</p>
                        <p>In order to my anſwer I premiſe;</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That <hi>that Dragon which is the grand Perſecutor of the Woman</hi> throughout this Chapter, from whom all her ſufferings originally ariſe, <hi>is</hi> (according to the Holy Ghoſts interpretation, verſ. 9.) <hi>that old Serpent, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Satan;</hi> He ſtands <hi>ready to devoure the Childe</hi> as ſoon as born, verſ. 4. He <hi>wars with Michael,</hi> verſ. 7. He <hi>drives the Woman</hi> into the Wilderneſs, verſ. 13, 14. He <hi>caſts a floud</hi> after her to drown her, verſ. 15. He <hi>makes war</hi> after this with the remnant of her ſeed, verſ. 17.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That <hi>this Dragon, Satan, being a spiritual and an inviſible enemy, and all the ſufferings of the Woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this day, having been ever cauſed by ſome outward and viſible means;</hi> Wee may not therefore conclude that it is by any immediate hand or act of the <hi>Dragon</hi> that the Woman ſuffers, but by ſome mediate hand; that is, ſome thing or power acted by this <hi>Dragon,</hi> and made an inſtrument to ſerve his deſign againſt the Woman; therefore is the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſaid in his fighting to make uſe of Angels, or Inſtruments, verſ. 7. and alſo in his fal
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56286:209"/>hath Angels, or Inſtruments, falling with him, verſ. 9.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 This <hi>thing, or power acted by the Dragon to afflict the Woman, is ſometimes one thing, ſometimes another;</hi> ſometimes one thing onely, ſometimes more than one; accordingly as he hath permiſſion to act this or that thing, and finds that by the acting of one thing, or of diverſe, he may beſt effect his own deſign of diſtreſſing, and if it might be, deſtroying the Woman, therefore before <hi>the Beaſt</hi> comes in, he acts the power of the <hi>Pagan Empire;</hi> after the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is come in, the power of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> more in general, but more particularly, the power of the <hi>German Empire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 That <hi>thing or power which is moſt commonly or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly governed by him, is in a diſtinct conſideration from all other things, or Powers, called by the name of the Dragon.</hi> So of all the Powers in the world, the <hi>Roman</hi> Power in the Primitive Ages goes under the name of <hi>the Dragon,</hi> verſ. 3. of all the Powers ſubjected to <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> the Power of <hi>the German Empire,</hi> is called the <hi>Dragon,</hi> verſ. 7.13.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Hence it follows, <hi>That thoſe attempts made againſt the Woman, or any of her ſeed, by that power which the Dragon properly governs and rules, and which in the phraſe of the Holy Ghoſt, uſed in this Chapter, takes denomination from him, are to be called the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or war of the viſible Dragon againſt the Woman;</hi> but thoſe attempts which through the ſubtilty of the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> ſecretly creeping into, and acting other powers than thoſe, which he properly and commonly rules and governs, and which do not take denomination from him, are made againſt the Woman, or any of her ſeed, it is more proper to call them the War of the inviſible <hi>Dragon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ground gained from the manifeſt truth of the Text, I come now to give in my anſwer, which is;</p>

The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Dragon</hi> kills the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> by acting the power of the <hi>viſible Dragon,</hi> or the <hi>German Empire,</hi> to do it; accordingly the <hi>inviſible Dragon</hi> ſhall attempt a <hi>War</hi> upon this <hi>remnant</hi> of the Womans ſeed, by acting in an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible</hi> way thoſe <hi>powers</hi> under whom this <hi>remnant</hi> of the Womans ſeed ſhall be.</p>
                        <p>Now that <hi>ſuch</hi> a War within this <hi>time</hi> ſhall be made upon this <hi>remnant</hi> by the <hi>inviſible Dragon,</hi> is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I have formerly ſaid) it is a thing both rational and of great uſe, <hi>That the whole myſtical body ſhould come under ſome meaſure of ſufferings in that time wherein the Witneſſes lye dead.</hi> Now becauſe this <hi>rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> ſhall not come into the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>viſible Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> for therefore (as I conceive) are they called a <hi>remnant,</hi> becauſe kept and reſerved by God from the <hi>mouth of the viſible Dragon,</hi> at the time their Fellow-Brethren are in it; it is therefore neceſſary, to the end there might bee in this <hi>remnant</hi> a ſympathie with their Brethren in their afflictions, that they ſhould within this time have ſome attempt made upon them by the <hi>inviſible Dragon.</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56286:210"/>
                           <hi>remnant,</hi> which is clear, becauſe that <hi>Dragen</hi> that kills the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> doth afterwards make an <hi>attempt</hi> upon this <hi>remnant;</hi> but the <hi>Dragon killing</hi> the Witneſſes, was not the <hi>inviſible</hi> only, but the <hi>viſible</hi> alſo; therefore the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Dragon,</hi> as well as the <hi>inviſible,</hi> ſhall <hi>attempt</hi> a War upon this <hi>remnant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall he do it?</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>drawing together the whole, or a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Papal power, whereof the viſible Dragon, or German Empire, ſhall bee chief, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in an open War againſt this remnant, if it may bee, to cut them off;</hi> but what the iſſue of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhall be, we ſhall ſee preſently, in opening the fourteenth Chapter, which (as I have ſaid) follows as the next thing in order after this.

                        <p n="4">4 That Character of theſe, verſ. 4. <hi>Theſe are they that follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes,</hi> doth (as I have ſaid before) clearly <hi>intimate to me,</hi> that this <hi>time</hi> is not the Lambs firſt ſetting forth, he had been marching before, <hi>viz.</hi> from the firſt day the <hi>Vials</hi> began to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth, yea <hi>fighting</hi> before, for the <hi>fight</hi> between <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon, chap.</hi> 12. and that betwixt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the Kings of the <hi>Earth, Chap.</hi> 17. do both <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> this time; by conſequence therefore this muſt be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the Vials, for the <hi>Lamb</hi> began not his <hi>march</hi> till <hi>the Vials</hi> began to be poured forth.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 <hi>John</hi> ſees <hi>no Throne</hi> as yet when <hi>the Vials</hi> began to be poured out, becauſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as then, was but breaking in upon the world; but now (as we obſerved before) <hi>John</hi>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56286:214"/>ſees a <hi>Throne,</hi> noting, that at this day <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath gotten ſome footing in the world, ſo much, as in deſpight of them he can, and doth erect a <hi>Throne.</hi> And this conſideration will ſave us an anſwer to that which ſeems to he as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the words, againſt the thing we are ſpeaking; <hi>viz. That this one hundred ſorty four thouſand, at their firſt Rendezvouz, have no Temple, but thoſe who pour out the Vials had, it ſeems therefore that they ſhould be the lower, and theſe the higher.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though true, no particular mention is made of a <hi>Temple,</hi> but theſe are onely ſaid to ſtand upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> yet have they that which is more, namely, a <hi>Throne,</hi> and this thoſe who began the work of the Vials had not, nor indeed could they then, becauſe Chriſt erects himſelf a <hi>Throne,</hi> by caſting down the <hi>Thrones</hi> of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> but this work is done by the Vials, and therefore there could not be a <hi>Throne</hi> before.</p>
                        <p>From the whole it is clear, That the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> is to be placed <hi>higher</hi> than the <hi>Head</hi> of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 Hence we have done well to <hi>place the beginning of the Vials,</hi> as we have done in our Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hence that <hi>opinion</hi> which makes this Prophecie to <hi>contemporiſe</hi> with the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is diſproved, and our former method <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Should any here ask me a reaſon why the <hi>Head of the Vials is placed ſomewhat upwards in the Beaſts Kingdom, and the head of this Chapter about the end of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>principal</hi> work of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to do which, this 144000 are raiſed up, is to <hi>ſmite Antichriſt</hi> in his Civil <hi>Inonarchical</hi> power, thereby to take his Kingdom from him, and to bring the Kingdoms
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56286:215"/>of this world under the <hi>Scepter</hi> of Chriſt; but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes to deal with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in his <hi>Civil Power,</hi> he deals with him upon another account, namely, of his <hi>encroachments</hi> upon Chriſts <hi>ſpiritual</hi> rights, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them out of his hands, as I have obſerved upon the <hi>Vials,</hi> p. 260, 261, 262.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe the <hi>Vials</hi> ſet forth the whole of Chriſts dealing with Antichriſt in a way of wrath; as well his dealing with him upon a Spiritual account, as a Civil, therefore is the head of the <hi>Vials</hi> ſeated more upwards in Antichriſts Kingdom, than the Head of this Chapter which is placed at the end of it. This further confirmes me, that in my Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Vials,</hi> I have been guided to place the beginning of the Vials aright, and in its proper place.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Another thing following from our Diſcourſe in the fore-going Section, is, <hi>That this</hi> 144000 <hi>which ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion, are not the ſame with the ſealed</hi> 144000, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. which alſo farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe <hi>the ſealed one hundred forty four thouſand,</hi> are ſealed by way of <hi>preſervation</hi> againſt ſome evill approaching; but this <hi>one hundred forty four thouſand</hi> are <hi>gathered together</hi> to do ſome work for Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſealed</hi> 144000. are ſealed before any of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound;</hi> but this <hi>one hundred forty four thouſand</hi> are not <hi>congregated</hi> till about the time of the <hi>Witneſſes riſe,</hi> which is not till the latter end of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet, Rev.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. That the ſealed One hundred forty four thouſand are ſealed before any of the Trumpets ſound, is clear;</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the very plagues that they are ſealed for preſervation againſt, are no other but the plagues of the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> The plagues themſelves are mentioned Chap.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56286:215"/>7.3. <hi>Hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have ſealed the Servants of our God in the fore head.</hi> Three ſorts of plagues here are: 1 A <hi>plague upon the earth;</hi> this is expreſly the plague of the <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> Chap. 8.7. <hi>The firſt Angel ſounded, and there followed hail, and fire mingled with blood, and they were caſt upon the earth.</hi> 2. <hi>A plague upon the Sea;</hi> this is the plague of the <hi>ſecond Trumpet,</hi> v. 8. <hi>And the ſecond Angel ſounded, and as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was caſt into the Sea, and the third part of the Sea became blood,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>And the third part of the creatures that were in the Sea, and had life, dyed, and the third part of ſhips were deſtroyed.</hi> 3. <hi>A plague upon the Trees;</hi> this is a part of the plague of the <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>The third part of Trees were burnt up, and all green graſs was burnt up.</hi> Now the <hi>plagues</hi> being the <hi>very plagues</hi> of the <hi>two firſt Trumpets,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, that this <hi>ſealing</hi> is, in time and order, before any of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe an expreſs command is given to the Locuſts under the fifth Trumpet, that <hi>they ſhould hurt none but thoſe onely, which had not the ſeal of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> Chap. 9.4. A clear Argument the <hi>ſealing</hi> was higher, for the <hi>ſeal</hi> was then ſet upon Gods Servants, and not a thing to be ſet for future, and undoubtedly the words point us back to that very <hi>ſealing,</hi> Chap. 7. which was before; yet the ſeventh Seal, which uſhers in all the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, was opened.</p>
                        <p>The reſult is, <hi>That the One hundred forty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, which ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>are not the ſame perſons, neither do they belong to the ſame time, with the One hundred forty four thouſand ſealed ones,</hi> the one belong to the <hi>firſt times of the Beaſt,</hi> the other to his <hi>laſt;</hi> the one are a company ſealed at the time of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> coming in the other are a company
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56286:216"/>congregated at the time of his going out.</p>
                        <p>To ſay, becauſe the one are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed in their foreheads,</hi> Chap. 7.3. the other to have the <hi>Fathers name written in their foreheads,</hi> Chap. 14.1. therefore they muſt be the <hi>ſame perſons,</hi> and either Prophecy relate to the <hi>ſame time,</hi> would have ſome colour of reaſon, in caſe the thing it ſelf, by other ſubſtantial Arguments, were firſt proved, but till that is done, to urge this alone, is to begge the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Nay, could the thing be proved, it would yet be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether the <hi>Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers Name,</hi> are <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> thing? and put caſe they are, another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will ariſe, Whether the <hi>end</hi> of ſealing be not one thing, and the <hi>end</hi> of writing the Fathers name another? and if the ends be diſtinct, then may the times alſo. All this muſt be throughly cleared, before any Argument can be drawn hence.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why the <hi>Congregated</hi> ones are ſet forth by the number of 144000 which is the number of the ſealed ones, I take to be,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the <hi>number of</hi> 144000. were the <hi>Lambs choſen number</hi> formerly, and therefore they are the <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen number</hi> ſtill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> One hundred forty four thouſand were the <hi>number he went off the ſtage with,</hi> when for a time he gave way to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and therefore they are the <hi>number</hi> which now (the Beaſts time being out) he comes on with again.</p>
                        <p>As for any <hi>Myſtery</hi> in the <hi>Number it ſelf,</hi> it doth not appear to me that there is <hi>any,</hi> the uſe of this number, Chap. 14. being with alluſion to the ſame Number, Chap. 7. and as for any Myſtery there, I cann ſee none, ſave onely that <hi>Twelve times twelve</hi> (that being the way of numbering there, twelve, which is a definite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being put for an indefinite) makes up One hundred
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56286:216"/>forty four, and therefore ſo many <hi>twelve thouſands</hi> are called one hundred forty four thouſand.</p>

                        <p>THe former things premiſed, to the end wee may know where we are, I now come to the <hi>matter of this Prophecy,</hi> which ſets forth the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Church, within the <hi>third period;</hi> i. e. from the <hi>ending</hi> of the Forty two Moneths, the One thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, until the <hi>beginning</hi> of the One thouſand years.</p>
                        <p>My intent as touching it, is not to carry an expoſition through the whole, examining as I go each particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, with the minds of Writers upon it, that being a work which would prove tedious to my ſelf, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Reader, but onely to give my own thoughts, as touching ſome things that are of more general concernment, and will be of more ſpecial uſe.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall ſum up all within the compaſs of theſe four things;</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Who <hi>theſe one hundred forty four thouſand ſhall be.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>cauſe and manner of this glorious Rendezvouz,</hi> and the ſtate or condition this 144000 upon their firſt congregating ſhall be in.</p>

                        <p>As touching the firſt, <hi>Who this one hundred forty four thouſand ſhall be;</hi> I anſwer, They ſhall be <hi>the Gentile-Saints;</hi> My Reaſons are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are <hi>the renmnant of that Womans ſeed,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are ſuch as the <hi>Antichriſtian German Dragon</hi> in the <hi>expiring time of the</hi> 1260 <hi>dayes ſhall raiſe a war againſt;</hi> but they are the Gentile Saints.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are ſuch, who within the time that the Witneſſes lye dead, before the 1260 years are fully expired, <hi>are eminent for keeping the Commandements of God, and having amongſt them the teſtimony of Chriſt:</hi> But this cannot agree to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in is not till afterwards; therefore muſt be the Gentile Saints.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are <hi>gathered to a Rendezvouz, and have glorious Characters upon them,</hi> and that before the downful of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will appear, compare verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. with verſ. 8. therefore cannot be the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt is not till afterwards, but muſt be the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Saints.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, I ſay no more, there is nothing in all this Chapter, ſave a ſingle clauſe towards the end, that relates to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the whole hath <hi>relation to the riſen Witneſſes,</hi> or Genti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As for the 144000 <hi>ſealed ones, Chap.</hi> 7. I ſpake my thoughts of them but now, which cannot be applied to any converſion of the natural <hi>Jews,</hi> unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe ſome converſion paſt many ages ſince; indeed the Text affords ſome probabilities for this Opinion, the <hi>Angel</hi> that hath the Seal coming from the Eaſt, verſ. 2. the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tribe, by name, together with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing deſcription of the <hi>new Jeruſalem.</hi> As for that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument urged by ſome, from the <hi>multitude of all Nations,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56286:217"/>Kindreds, People, and Tongues,</hi> ver. 9. whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are ſpoken of by way of diſtinction from the ſealed company, it proves not; becauſe, ſhould we ſuppoſe the <hi>Sealed company</hi> to be <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it is clear to me, that <hi>the Sealed company</hi> relate to one time, the great <hi>multitude of all Nations, Kindreds, People, and Tongues</hi> to another, and thereby the ground of diſtinction as to perſons is taken away; for if theſe two relate to two times, then may we by the one underſtand <hi>the Jews,</hi> by the other, <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> onely, or <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both. But to paſs this, as for the probabilities the Text doth afford us, though I could as much as another incline to the opinion, yet muſt I ſay, I am convinced of it, they are but weak, and will in no wiſe counterpoiſe our former Arguments laid down to the contrary; yet if a way might be found out to reconcile both, that is, to make this <hi>ſealing</hi> to have a reſpect to <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Jews</hi> too, to the <hi>Spiritual Jews,</hi> about the time that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> came into the World, to the <hi>Natural,</hi> upon the time of his going out; which latter, though their coming in unto Chriſt be long after the other, yet becauſe they are the elder Siſter, are chiefly ſpoken of, and their Tribes mentioned by name, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under them, it would be a thing very deſirable. The doing of this may ſeem a thing impoſſible, but yet poſſibly it is not ſo, Something looking this way I have very lately had in mine eye, that it will do the thing I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, if it would, I conceive it not meet here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it.</p>
                        <p>Yet for truths ſake, to the end the thing in hand may be the more clear, and free from all exception, let us not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our former Arguments, ſuppoſe at preſent the one hundred forty four thouſand ſealed ones to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the ſealing to note a <hi>converſion</hi> of that people yet to <hi>come;</hi> yet will it not therefore follow, that the <hi>one hundred forty four thouſand ſtanding</hi> with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56286:218"/>the <hi>Lamb</hi> upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo; for there ſeems to be good reaſon for it, why in caſe the other ſhould be the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> here ſhould be ſet forth by the very ſame number.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The 144000 of the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſo called, becauſe <hi>the picked and ſealed ones of that people;</hi> but theſe being the <hi>picked and ſealed ones of the Gentiles,</hi> may well be ſet forth by the very ſame number of 144000.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>day</hi> in which the 144000 <hi>of the ſealed Jews</hi> are ſo <hi>numbred,</hi> is the <hi>firſt day</hi> that that People, as a Nation, ſhall be <hi>delivered</hi> from their bondage, and enter into Chriſts reſt. This Rendezvouz, we read of Chap. 11. is the very <hi>firſt day</hi> of the <hi>Gentile Saints deliverance</hi> from Antichriſtian bondage, and entring the Spiritual <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> of reſt, after that long Wilderneſs-condition, and therefore well may theſe be ſet forth by the ſame number of 144000, with the other.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>Jews</hi> in the day of that Nations coming in unto Chriſt, ſhall <hi>come in a great multitude,</hi> in which reſpect it is ſaid of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.8. <hi>Shall a Nation be born at once?</hi> therefore ſet forth by a <hi>greas number</hi> of ſealed ones, <hi>viz.</hi> 144000; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at the <hi>time</hi> of the Witneſſes riſe ſhall ſtand up a <hi>great multitude,</hi> ſet forth therefore verſ. 2. by the <hi>voyce of many waters,</hi> and at the time of <hi>Romes</hi> ruine, which ſhall be ſuddenly upon their riſe; <hi>John</hi> heats a <hi>voyce of much people,</hi> Rev. 19, 1. <hi>Of a great multitude, of many waters, and mighty thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings</hi> (arguing abundance of <hi>Gentiles</hi> now come in) <hi>ſinging Hallelujah, praiſes for</hi> Romes <hi>ruine,</hi> verſ. 6. therefore well may theſe alſo be ſet forth by a great number, yea the ſame of 144000.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> two Nations, whereof one only had the priviledge to be Gods people under the Law, the other hath this priviledge under the Goſpel, being now both by this great confluence of either to Chriſt to bee

                        <p>To ſay no more, the ſum of all is, That the 144000, here ſpoken of, are the <hi>Gentile</hi> Saints.</p>

                        <p>But the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> ſhall be <hi>the Lambs ſtanding upon Mount Sion,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>And I looked, and lo a Lamb ſtood upon the Mount Sion, and with him</hi> 144000— This ſtanding upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> we are to underſtand of <hi>Chriſts more glorious manifeſtation</hi> of himſelf, in his meekneſs, grace, and love, the precious vertue of his Death and Sacrifice (in which reſpect he is called a Lamb) to his <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> where this <hi>remn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nt</hi> ſhall be, and that more generally at this time. He ſhall make his people generally and wondrouſly ſenſible of the greatneſs of his pardoning love, and how he hath ingaged ſo far as to become himſelf a Sacrifice for them; withal aſſuring their hearts, <hi>That the day is come, that he is to take his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and now all they can do for him in way of requital, is to gather about him and help him, to ſtand by him in his great work of taking vengeance on the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> overturning the <hi>Thrones of Kingdomes;</hi> and therefore he calls upon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56286:219"/>them now to quit all earthly reſpects, and intereſts, and ſtraight-way to ariſe, liſt under his Banner, and if they will but ſtand to him, though they may have their failings and haltings, yet will not he uſe martial Law, but lead them, and march before them, with meekneſs, gentleneſs, and love. Here is the principal efficient cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>manner of their Rendezvouz,</hi> we have verſ. 2. <hi>And I heard a voyce from Heaven, as the voyce of many waters</hi>— the phraſe ſeems to intimate, as if the thing ſhould be by ſome <hi>general tumult,</hi> a mighty ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of waters, a voyce and cry amongſt the waters. Now <hi>Waters</hi> in Apocalyptical phraſe, and elſewhere, (as I have obſerved in opening the ſubject of the third Vial) denote the <hi>common people,</hi> and in this place it is neceſſary we ſo interpret it, becauſe the <hi>voyce of Waters</hi> is <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from the <hi>voyce of Thunder,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> hears after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>And further obſerve, theſe <hi>waters</hi> are not the <hi>common waters,</hi> but they are the <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> i.e. of the true Church, and its members, therefore the <hi>voyce of waters</hi> is heard from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea further obſerve, the voice of waters from Heaven is a <hi>great voyce,</hi> for it is a voyce not of a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many waters,</hi> noting, that the Spirit now acting ſhall be general, the cry to ariſe, general.</p>
                        <p>There had been a <hi>little ruſhing of waters</hi> before, a cry of one here, another there; but now, what was before ſet home upon ſome particular hearts, is upon the hearts of Gods people in general, and the <hi>voyce of waters</hi> is a great and <hi>general voyce,</hi> the cry runs on the ſudden throughout the Churches and Saints, and all are inſtantly upon their legs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> they ſhall be in upon this their Rendezvouz, is ſet forth in two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They ſhall be <hi>owned by ſome eminent Head whom
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56286:219"/>God will either raiſe up among them, or make to appear for them.</hi> This <hi>Head</hi> is noted by the <hi>voyce</hi> of the <hi>great Thunder,</hi> it being the phraſe of the Holy Ghoſt in this Book to call the common people <hi>Waters,</hi> the Heads and great ones <hi>Thundrings,</hi> Rev. 19.6. <hi>I heard the voyce of many Waters, and the voyce of mighty Thundrings, ſaying, Hallelujah.</hi> It teacheth us thus much, That Chriſt will raiſe up ſome ſuch faithful Inſtrument to bee his Lieutenant General to lead on this his 144000, whoſe name ſhall be as a great <hi>Thunder</hi> in the world, dreadful and terrible to the Antichriſtian party.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is the <hi>voyce</hi> of but one <hi>Thunder,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, that at this firſt <hi>Rendezvouz,</hi> there ſhall appear but ſome <hi>one</hi> noted <hi>Head</hi> for Chriſt, but a while after, when the work is gotten a little forwarder, we hear of <hi>many Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,</hi> Rev. 19.6. <hi>i.e.</hi> many great One, Heads, Rulers, who either wanted opportunity or courage at firſt, ſhall now come in, and joyn with this party.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 They ſhall <hi>begin their march with praiſes.</hi> The <hi>Lamb</hi> being now upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> his <hi>remnant</hi> gathered about him, an <hi>eminent Head</hi> by Chriſt raiſed up, and ſet over them, the firſt work they do is to ſing praiſes. <hi>I heard the voyce of Harpers, harping with their Harps.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt in theſe words alludes to the way of praiſing God in time of Old, when Gods people in their praiſes made uſe of Inſtruments of Muſick, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and as that which was in moſt common uſe, of the Harp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.22.</p>
                        <p>And methinks the <hi>firſt ſetting forth</hi> of the 144000. ſeems to be much like <hi>Jehoſhaphats march againſt the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. <hi>An infinite multitude of people, and Nations like the ſand of the Sea, come up together againſt Jehoſhaphat and Judah.</hi> The <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>rumor</hi> of their <hi>coming,</hi> doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe it being the <hi>Stone</hi> alone that breaks the <hi>Great Image</hi> by ſmiting him on the Feer and Toes, we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56286:220"/>are there to place the <hi>riſe</hi> of it, where the <hi>Civil power</hi> of Antichriſt, in any of the ten Horns (repreſented by the ten Toes) is <hi>irrecoverably broken</hi> to peeces. But the doing of this is <hi>begun</hi> with the third <hi>Vial,</hi> therefore with the <hi>beginning</hi> of that are we to place the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Stone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Daniels Stone</hi> that <hi>ſmites,</hi> Chap. 2. and his <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> that <hi>ſits,</hi> Chap. 7. being one and the ſame, we are to reckon the <hi>riſe</hi> of the <hi>Stone</hi> from the <hi>firſt day</hi> that the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> began to ſit, and to caſt down any of the <hi>Thrones</hi> of the fourth <hi>Beaſt.</hi> But this work was <hi>begun</hi> with the <hi>beginning</hi> of the third <hi>Vial,</hi> therefore there are we to <hi>begin</hi> the <hi>Stone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let us look upon the <hi>work</hi> done of <hi>late yeers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either of theſe <hi>notions,</hi> either as it is a <hi>breaking of the great Image,</hi> or as it is <hi>caſting down</hi> the <hi>Thrones</hi> of the fourth <hi>Beaſt,</hi> for both are ſubſtantially the <hi>ſame,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally wrought by the <hi>Stone,</hi> and hath it not been done by a deſpiſed handful, which worldly powers would not have raiſed up at firſt, could they have holpen it, nor continued when raiſed, could they have had their will; but as the raiſing, ſo the continuing hath been from God more immediately, than by the endeavour of hands, <hi>i.e.</hi> humane means.</p>

                        <p>OUr third Particular comes now into conſideration, namely, to conſider of the <hi>Characters</hi> of this 144000.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>ſeveral Characters,</hi> we have verſ. 3.4. I have given my thoughts of them already in the Epiſtle Dedicatory to my late Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Vials;</hi> But what I then wrote being but as the firſt day-break of light into this Prophecie, and hoping (through grace) that I do now begin to ſee thoſe things a little more clearly, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fully than at that time I did, I ſhall notwithſtanding go over the whole again.</p>
                        <p>The firſt <hi>Character</hi> of them, <hi>viz. That they ſtand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion,</hi> relating more to their <hi>condition,</hi> than their <hi>qualification,</hi> I ſhall be ſilent as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and the rather, becauſe I have opened it already, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. That omitted, we have beſides it eight Characters in the Text.</p>
                        <p n="1">I <hi>CHARACTER. They have their Fathers Name written in their fore-heads,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>i.e.</hi> they ſhall bee ſuch who ſhall <hi>know</hi> one another by no <hi>mark,</hi> but only the <hi>Image</hi> of the Father, the <hi>Fathers Name written in their-fore-heads.</hi> And I take it that <hi>this is ſpoken</hi> of the 144000 followers of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Beaſts</hi> followers, of whom we read a little before, Chap. 13.16. <hi>That they have a mark written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beads, i.e.</hi> they make up a judgement of perſons by ſome <hi>mark</hi> given to them, one hath this <hi>mark,</hi> another
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56286:221"/>that <hi>mark,</hi> and men (as well good men as others) all the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdome, know one another by <hi>marks,</hi> and ſuch marks as are of the <hi>Beasts</hi> deviſing. But now when the <hi>Beaſt</hi> goes off the Stage, and the <hi>Lamb</hi> comes up, all <hi>marks</hi> that formerly men were known by are laid <hi>aſide,</hi> and now there is no <hi>mark</hi> to know Saints by, but only this, <hi>The Fathers Name written in their fore-heads;</hi> There ſhall be no knowledge of Perſons, as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as <hi>Independents,</hi> as Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. any longer, but the <hi>mark,</hi> the <hi>only mark</hi> that Saints ſhall know one another by, ſhall be the Image of the Father, <hi>The Fathers Name written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ſhall be the <hi>mark</hi> by which Saints in the time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> when the <hi>Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one,</hi> ſhall know one another by, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>His Name ſhall be in their fore-heads, i.e.</hi> Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Image</hi> of the Father, ſhall be ſo viſible in them, that there ſhall be no need of any other <hi>mark</hi> to know one another by, but all ſhall be known unto each other by this. The <hi>beginnings</hi> of this ſhall be very <hi>eminent</hi> in this <hi>One hundred forty four thouſand,</hi> and therefore we have this laid down as the great <hi>Character</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">II <hi>CHARACTER. They ſing a new Song which none can learn, but only this One hundred forty four thouſand,</hi> ver. 3. The meaning is, This <hi>One hundred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four thouſand</hi> ſhall go a <hi>ſtrain higher</hi> in their actings and praiſes, then the Saints before them <hi>did;</hi> and for this reaſon many of the old Singers that ſung the firſt Song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. ſhall not be able to ſing this, it ſhall go in a note too high and ſpiritual for them.</p>
                        <p n="3">III <hi>CHARACTER. They are ſuch as are redeemed from the Farth, i.e.</hi> (as I conceive) ſuch only as have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſtand looſe from <hi>earthly intereſt,</hi> being perſons d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>CHARACTER. They are Virgin-Saints, not defiled with women,</hi> verſ. 4. I take this <hi>Character</hi> to be a <hi>Character</hi> diſtinct from the former, though not long ſince I judged either the ſame. And yet withall, the difference is no great matter, the former noting redemption from earthly intereſts and engagements in the general, <hi>i.e.</hi> earthly intereſts of all ſorts, by which men, yea Saints themſelves are oftentimes miſ-lead, and drawn aſide from following Chriſt; but this latter denotes redemption in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial kind, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Antichriſtian intereſts,</hi> the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar defilements of the whoriſh Woman; the meaning is, this One hundred forty four thouſand ſhall be a <hi>ſelect number of ſuch perſons,</hi> who notwithſtanding for a great part of their time <hi>they lived</hi> within <hi>the verge</hi> of that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous ſuperſtitious age,</hi> in which the <hi>whole world</hi> went a <hi>whoring</hi> after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> yet did in that <hi>adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation</hi> keep themſelves <hi>Virgins,</hi> not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>fornication</hi> with <hi>the Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by having any hand in her <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>CHARACTER. They follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth, i.e.</hi> They ſhall be ſuch who from the day they began to follow the <hi>Lamb, have ever kept him company in his moſt difficult paths, through rockie, craggie, thorny wayes;</hi> In dangerous paths, where they have been neceſſitated to put their lives in their hands to follow him; in deſolate wilderneſs-paths, where they have been in a manner ſtripped bare of all outward comforts and injoyments, yet willing to quit all, rather than leave his company, in paths contrary to reaſon, fleſh, and blood, to their own preferments, intereſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch ſhall theſe be. And this <hi>Character</hi> (I take it) is <hi>given to them</hi> in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>thoſe</hi> who did follow the <hi>Lamb
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56286:222"/>ſometime,</hi> ſo long as it ſtood with their ſafety, pleaſure, honor, preferment, profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when in following him they could have theſe no longer, they will follow him <hi>no further,</hi> the Lamb may march alone for them.</p>

                        <p>THe fourth and laſt thing comes now to be handled, <hi>viz.

                        </p>
                        <p>There are but two clear Prophecies in all the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that afford us matter for an anſwer to this Queſtion; 1. That of the <hi>Vials, Chap.</hi> 16. taking in alſo its expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the following Chapters. 2. That of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſen,</hi> hinted <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. enlarged in this 14 <hi>Chapter.</hi> As for ſo much as concerns our Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on compriſed in the firſt, I have handled that in opening the <hi>Vials,</hi> and ſhall not here repeat it. What may be collected from <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. I have given ſome general hints of it likewiſe in our firſt Chapter. All therefore I intend to do at preſent ſhall be to take up ſome few Obſervations, as lie couched in this Chapter, and will add ſome little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light than what hath been already brought forth, to the Queſtion in hand.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 More generally, <hi>The work ſhall go on with a more ſwift and irreſiſtable hand than ever formerly.</hi> Now ſhall not all the means and endeavors that can by the world
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56286:223"/>or hell it ſelf be uſed, be able to hinder, but the wrath of God as a mighty over-flowing deluge ſhall irreſiſtably come in upon the Antichriſtian ungodly world. This ſeems to me to be noted in that running and poſting of Angels one after another, ſo ſoon as ever the work is ſet upon this Baſis, verſ. 6. <hi>I ſaw another Angel flie in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>And there followed another Angel ſaying,</hi> Babylon <hi>is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>And the third Angel followed them, ſaying with a loud voyce, If any man worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, or receive his mark in his fore-head, or in his hand; The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.</hi> Verſ. 15. <hi>And another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel came out of the Temple</hi>—. Verſ. 17. <hi>And another Angel came out of the Temple</hi>—. Verſ. 18. <hi>And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel came out from the Altar, which had power over fire.</hi> The poſting of Angels argues the work now to be hot, it runs like fire in a Thatch, every Angel or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes a quick and ſpeedy diſpatch of his work.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 More particularly, we have theſe things noted in the following part of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The <hi>everlaſting Goſpell is preached,</hi> verſ. 6, 7. <hi>And I ſaw another Angel flye in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, and to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People, ſaying with a loud voyce, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come, and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of waters.</hi> Five things we have here obſervable concerning this preaching of the Goſpel, which ſhall be at this day.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The <hi>wonderful purity, and ſimplicity of the Doctrine of the Goſpel as now held forth</hi> it ſhall be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from thoſe Antichriſtian mixtures and devices of man, which tend to nothing elſe but to corrupt and darken the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56286:224"/>pure word of the Goſpel, and lead ſouls from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel. Hence it is called the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be now preached as it was at firſt; or all that droſs that hath been, and is in the Doctrine of the beſt Preachers hitherto, ſhall now be purged out, and that onely which will abide the fire, and ſhall be everlaſting, ſhall remain.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>matter it ſelf,</hi> that ſhall be held forth as one principal part of this <hi>everlaſting Goſpel, ſhall be thoſe things which concern Chriſt, judging the great Whore, and all his enemies, and the ſetting up of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, calling upon the Rulers of this world to worſhip the Lamb, throw down their Crowns, and Scepter at his feet;</hi> and therefore obſerve the matter of the Sermon is, <hi>Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgement is come, and worſhip him that made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth,</hi> &amp;c. as to ſay, the time is come that the Lamb will judge the Whore, deſtroy the Beaſt, tremble all ye Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him, ye Kings and Princes of the earth be wiſe, give glory to him, Kiſs the Son, worſhip before him who made Heaven, Earth, the Sea, and the Fountains of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way, as he is in his march to his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The <hi>univerſal ſpreading of this Doctrine abroad, and that as it were in a moment;</hi> therefore the Angel, to note the ſwiftneſs of carrying it, is ſaid to <hi>flye,</hi> and to ſhew the univerſal ſpreading of it, it is ſaid to be <hi>preached, to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 The <hi>publick, and boldholding of it forth;</hi> ſuch a ſpirit ſhall be upon the Preachers, that they ſhall not whiſper theſe things, and ſpeak them in private corners; but openly and boldly in the Market-ſtreet; yea, in the very faces of the Kings and Princes of the Earth. Hence to note the publickneſs of it, the Angel is ſaid to <hi>flie in the midſt of Heaven, i.e.</hi> openly, in the view of all, and to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56286:224"/>note the publickneſs and boldneſs both, is ſaid to <hi>proclaim it with a loud voyce.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 The <hi>great meaſure of faith that ſhall be upon the Preachers, as to this particular buſineſs, that the very time is come in which God will judge the Whore,</hi> therefore they cry out, <hi>The hour of his judgement is come.</hi> As to ſay, Flatter your ſelves no longer, O ye Papiſts, ſit ſtill no longer, O ye Proteſtants, with this in your mouths, <hi>the time is not come, the time is not come,</hi> for aſſure your ſelves Chriſt will now delay no longer, <hi>The hour of his judgement is come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Romes <hi>deſtruction now comes unavoidably upon her,</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>And there followed another Angel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Babylon <hi>is fallen, is fallen.</hi> The words <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> are not (as I conceive) to be looked upon as words of faith concerning a work to be done, but rather a Proclamation of a work already done. This Angel is but the Meſſenger and Herauld of thoſe glad tydings, who ſpreads this news over the Churches and Nations; which what with the greatneſs of it, the ſuddenneſs, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedneſs of it, begets ſuch wonderment, and joy, that the whole World in a manner is filled with <hi>Hallelujah's, Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſerious and ſolemn warning to all thoſe who ſhall yet adhere to the Beaſt,</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>And the third Angel followed them, ſaying with a loud voyce, If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in his fore-head, and in his hand.</hi> Verſ. 10 <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>And the ſmock of their torment aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth up for ever and over, And they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56286:225"/>and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But why are the Papals warned by pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſo dreadful a threatning at this day?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon hereof I take to be this, becauſe the day of Chriſts coming, and the fatal ruin of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his followers, is now at hand, therefore the coming of Chriſt, and the treading of the Wine-preſs, follows immediately upon this.</p>
                        <p>Now Gods way is, ever before his fatal blow, to give his enemies ſuch a warning, as may both leave them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, and clear his juſtice before all men in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Hence in regard the dreadful day of the Lords wrath is immediately to approach, in which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is to be ſlain, his body deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame, the <hi>Beaſt and falſe Prophet</hi> both to be caſt into the Lake of fire burning with Brimſtone; that therefore the Juſtice of God in this moſt terrible execution of his wrath might be apparent unto Men and Angels, God, before he will ſtrike, ſtirs up ſome in a more ſpecial manner to make diſcovery among the Nations of the terror of the Day approaching, warning all, not to ſide, or have any thing to do with the <hi>Beast,</hi> whoſe final deſtruction and torment is at hand, and in caſe, notwithſtanding this warning they ſhall, this is that they muſt certainly and ſuddenly expect, to drink of the wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the Cup of his indignation, and to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb, the ſmoak of which torment of theirs, ſhall aſcend up for ever and ever.</p>
                        <p>I have ſometimes thought this <hi>Angel</hi> may be the ſame with that <hi>Ch.</hi> 19.17, 18. for both are immediately before the <hi>Great Day of God Almighty;</hi> both ſeem to have very clear light into that thing, of the deſtruction of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; therefore as the one paints out the very nature
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56286:225"/>and manner of their torments, ſo the other is ſaid (as to this parſicular, <hi>viz.</hi> of the certain ruine of Gods enemies) to ſtand in the Sun, <hi>i.e.</hi> in clear light; both ſpeak with abundance of ſaith, the one to the Papal power, aſſuring them of ruine; the other to the Fowls that flye in the midſt of Heaven, <hi>i.e.</hi> the neutral party, who would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn with the Conquering ſide, could they tell which that ſide would be, therefore are moſt fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>y deſcribed by ſuch Fowls, whoſe chief deſire is prey, and ſaid to flye in the midſt of Heaven, becauſe they keep themſelves as it were in the middle betwixt. Heaven and Earth, the Saints party, and the party of the Beaſt, not knowing which to fal in with, yet would willingly be of the winning ſide, and where they might have prey. Now theſe the Angel aſſures that if they will joyn with the people of God they ſhall have vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory and ſpoyl, be both of the winning ſide, and have prey to boot, as to ſay, You that waver, and are doubtful which ſide to take, would you bee of the proſpering ſide? take this then, for aſſuredly the Victory ſhall fall to this party.</p>
                        <p>Now whether or no theſe Angels are two, or but one, I ſhall not be curious to determine, nor is it a thing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial for us to know; Onely ſuch a thing may be, and it is not improper to ſay, That one and the ſame Angel may do both theſe works, and that in a manner together, <hi>viz.</hi> inform and invite the one, whilſt he threatneth and warneth the other.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 A ſweet <hi>word of Heavenly conſolation to the Saints and people of Chriſt, the bleſſed day of their redemption being now come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints; here are they that keep the Commandements of God, and the faith of Jeſus;</hi> That is, in effect, to ſay. Here is the end and fruit of the Saints patience, here is the bleſſed reward of keeping the Commandements of God, and holding the faith of Jeſus; Now, now the day is come, in which it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56286:226"/>ſhall appear that the Saints have loſt nothing by waiting patiently upon God for the fulfilling of his word, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandements of God, holding the faith of Jeſus. The world have looked upon them as fools, and counted their life a very priſon; but here, here are they that keep the Commandements of God; here is the day of making up a right judgement of them; here is their condition viſible from under a veil. Now, now, O yee world, look upon them, ſee what you think of them now, and of all their patience, obedience, and faith; whether were they fools, as you eſteemed them, or no?</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And laſt, <hi>We have Chriſts Perſonal coming,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate like unto the Son of man, having on his Head a golden Crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſickle.</hi> That Chriſts <hi>Perſonal coming</hi> is the thing held forth in theſe words appears,</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56286:227"/>ſtraight-way into Paradiſe, will not help us with an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; for who can think otherwiſe, but that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this moſt groſe opinion was laid open before, even when the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi> was preached, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.7. and if ſo, why then are they ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed</hi> from <hi>this time,</hi> and not rather from <hi>that time,</hi> when the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi> began to be preached? To ſay yet (as do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) becauſe great Perſecutions were now to ariſe, ſo that it was a bleſſing to be dead before they came. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

                        <p>For my own part, I do conceive that the thing here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated is the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which opinion, as it cuts off a multitude of uncertainties, ſo doth it agree moſt fitly to the circumſtance of time, according to the method I have obſerved, and is clear alſo from the Context, conſent of other Scriptures, and the words themſelves taken in their natural ſenſe, without ſtraining or forcing of them, being in effect thus much, as if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay; <hi>The children of God untill this day have been ever accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the worlds Fools, who have counted their life a burden and toyl, their death a loſs of their expectations; but now at this day of the Reſurrection, when the fruit of Gods peoples patience, their faith and obedience</hi> (of which was ſpoken in the foregoing verſe, which hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary dependance on this, and had we conjoyned them in our expoſition, as they are in the Text, it might poſſibly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56286:228"/>have been better) <hi>ſhall be manifeſted before all men;</hi> it ſhall then be ſeen that thoſe who in former ages, from the very beginning of the world, did live to the Lord, and dye in the Lord, are the onely bleſſed men, who from this day in Soul and Body both are made partakers, and that in recompence of their former toyl and labours, of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſt of Chriſt, having now their good works follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>i. e.</hi> the reward of all their former good works (which the world looked upon as things loſt, and caſt away) given to them.</p>
                        <p>Hence, (which ſerves to expound theſe words) the time of the ſeventh Angels ſounding, (which is contemporary with this, both looking to the time of Chriſts coming) is called the time of Gods giving a reward unto his Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and to them that fear his name ſmal and great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. which anſwers punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually to this of their works, <hi>i.e.</hi> the reward of their works following them.</p>
                        <p>By theſe two Scriptures I am further confirmed in what I have writen upon the Vials, <hi>viz.</hi> That not Martyrs onely, but all the Saints ſhall riſe in the firſt Reſurrection, and come with Chriſt; for the bleſſing here pronounced is common to all that dye in the Lord, yea, to all that have kept the patience, faith, and commandements of Chriſt, and not peculiar to Martyrs onely; the rewarding Saints in the time of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> is not a rewarding Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs onely, but all that fear Gods Name (a qualification common to Saints) ſmal and great.</p>
                        <p>As for the double ſimilitude in the following words, 1. Of a <hi>Harveſt,</hi> verſ. 15, 16. 2.

Further, whether the <hi>Angel</hi> with a Sickle, who gathers the <hi>Vintage,</hi> ver. 19. be any <hi>Angel</hi> that Chriſt makes uſe of at his coming, to deſtroy his enemies, as God by an <hi>Angel</hi> deſtroyed the Hoſt of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> or whether this <hi>Angel</hi> be <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who before is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> here an <hi>Angel</hi> (which name is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo given him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.17. which in my diſcourſe on the ſeventh Vial, I have ſhewed is to be underſtood of Chriſt) I ſhall not much inſiſt on, onely adding, that I rather incline to the latter, that it is <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56286:229"/>
                           <hi>Angel</hi> coming from the Altar, cryes with a loud voyce to this <hi>Angel</hi> to thruſt in his Sickle, and gather the cluſters of the earth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. therefore they ſeem to be one and the ſame, and Chriſt himſelf the perſon pointed at in both.</p>
                        <p>If here I may add my conjecture concerning theſe <hi>two Angels</hi> that cry with a loud voyce, to have this work of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage</hi> performed, I have a conceit, that the firſt may ſignifie, the <hi>Gentile Churches,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>Jews;</hi> who both about the <hi>inſtant time</hi> of Chriſts appearance are provoked, by ſeeing the whole world gathering together to ſwallow them up, to cry mightily to the Lord, to manifeſt his power for their preſervation; for which cauſe either are ſaid to <hi>cry with a loud voyce;</hi> and both by ſeeing the rage and height of the enemy, have ſaith to beleeve their deſtruction to be at hand; therefore either are brought in, <hi>pleading great words of faith.</hi> The firſt pleads, <hi>Reap O Lord, for the time is come to reap, the Harveſt of the Earth is ripe,</hi> verſ. 15. The ſecond pleads, <hi>Gather the cluſters of the Vine, for her Grapes are fully ripe,</hi> verſ. 18. and for this reaſon alſo may (as I conceive) the ſame thing be ſet forth under two Parables, that ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a clear way might be made for either of theſe two, firſt <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than <hi>Jews,</hi> to be brought in pleading with Chriſt, to ſhew forth his power and greatneſs at this day.</p>
                        <p>Now of theſe <hi>two,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>the Gentile Churches</hi> is ſaid to <hi>come out of the Temple;</hi> (yet not the Temple of Heaven, which the Angel of the Vintage, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt, comes forth of, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.) becauſe the <hi>Gentile-Saints</hi> had long before this time, even from the firſt day the Vials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be poured forth, had a <hi>Temple among them, Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6. this being the moſt remarkable thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, that they had a <hi>Temple,</hi> therefore are they deſcribed as coming thence.

                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56286:229"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>As touching the 1600 <hi>Furlongs,</hi> verſ. 20. conjectures are divers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Napiers</hi> opinion is, <q>
                              <hi>That it reſpects the date of this terrible day; who reads the words thus; Blood came out of the Wine-preſs unto the Horſe Bridles, by the ſpace of</hi> 1600 <hi>ſtades of courſes; as if (ſaith he) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearingly he ſhould mean Metaphorically as Wine may be thought to flow from the Preſs, or the blood of ſlain men in a Field to aſcend to the Horſe Bridles, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ſhall the torment of the wicked aſcend after that</hi> 1600 <hi>years be accompliſhed; for (ſaith our Author) theſe ſtades agree well to mean years, ſeeing a ſtade is that race or courſe that one may be thought to run
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56286:230"/>with one breath, before he begin to renew his breath again; as one year is that race or courſe that the Sun makes in a Circuit, before he begin to renew his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit again. Now counting</hi> 1600 <hi>years from the time that this was written, which was about the</hi> 97 <hi>year of Chriſt, as</hi> Euſebius <hi>in his Chronicle ſaith, or in the end of the reign of</hi> Domitian, <hi>as</hi> Irenaeus <hi>ſaith, which was</hi> An. Dom. 99. <hi>the end of the account ſhall fall out about the year of Chriſt,</hi> 1697. <hi>or</hi> 1699.</q> Thus <hi>Napier.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This agrees well to the time of Chriſts coming, as the ſame is held forth in other Scriptures, onely falls two or three years ſooner. Now whether Chriſt, who tels us, that <hi>for the Elects ſake the days ſhall be ſhortned, Matth.</hi> 24.22. may not by reaſon of that ſharp trouble that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes his coming, ſhorten by ſo much as this comes to, that determined time of his coming, which we have in <hi>Daniel,</hi> I will not ſay, yet a ſeeming probability of ſome ſuch thing there is in our Saviours words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mayer</hi> hath an opinion, that this may relate to the place; quoting <hi>Rabbi Menahen</hi> upon <hi>Gen. fol.</hi> 60. who affirmeth, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was 1600. <hi>Furlongs</hi> in length. Now (ſaith our Author) for ſo much as all things are carried here on in an Allegory to the Temple, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and the Holy City which were of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I doubt not but in this ſpace without the City it is alſo alluded unto that Country, ſuch an innumerable multitude are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as if ſuch a ſlaughter of men were made, as would overflow in this depth, all the whole land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This opinion the Prophets favor, in that general concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is amongſt them, that the battle of <hi>Armageddon</hi> (which is that treading of the Wine-preſs here mentioned) ſhall be in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> near <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence that opinion falls to the ground, which would have this 1600 <hi>Furlongs</hi> to be a deſignation of <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which (ſaith the Author of it) in the longeſt extent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56286:230"/>thereof, from the wals of <hi>Rome</hi> to the River <hi>Po,</hi> is exactly 1600 <hi>Furlongs,</hi> whence (ſaith he) its probable that the Popes own Territories, may prove the Cock-pit of this execution, whither Chriſt as into a Wine-preſs, will from all parts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bloody grapes, when he means to tread them.</p>
                        <p>Another opinion I find hereof, which applies 1600 <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> to the greatneſs of the puniſhment, which ſhall befall the enemys of Chriſt at this day, and that in reſpect both of the multitude of thoſe who ſhall be puniſhed, and the length of their torment. <hi>Blood</hi> flowing ſo great a depth as to the <hi>Horſe Bridles,</hi> and this, for 1600 <hi>Furlongs,</hi> is an Argument both of abundance of blood, and a long time of preſſing.</p>
                        <p>This conjecture alſo agrees well to the Prophets, who ſpeaking of this day, make mention of multitudes that ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.14, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. &amp; 39. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.14, 16. &amp; 19.19, 20, 21. and alſo of length of torment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24.</p>
                        <p>Now ſeeing that either of theſe opinions will, and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in other places, where mention is made of this day, I judge it moſt ſafe not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the interpretation of ſo great a myſtery to any one, but as the wiſdom of God in Scriptures more plain, much more in places ſo myſtical, is manifold, ſo to conceive that either, <hi>viz.</hi> the time, place, and greatneſs of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo may be here intended.</p>
                        <p>Thus once more we are come unto <hi>the day of Chriſts appearing,</hi> which though looked for but by a <hi>few,</hi> yet doubtleſs <hi>haſtens</hi> upon us. By how much this bleſſed time is nearer, by ſo much the more doth it call upon us to have our eyes fixed thereupon; to awake, ariſe, put on our beautiful garments, and ſhake our ſelves of our duſt; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up our courage, our zeal, our life, our love to Chriſt, his cauſe and people; reſolving within our ſelves for <hi>Sions ſake not to hold our peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>ſake to give him no reſt, till the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56286:231"/>brightneſs, and the ſalvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth;</hi> till ſhe who now is termed forſaken, and her land called deſolate, ſhall become a <hi>Crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the hand of our God,</hi> and be no more called <hi>Hephzibab,</hi> nor her land <hi>Beulah,</hi> but the Lords delight, marryed unto him, the praiſe of the whole earth, an eternal excellency, a joy of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a City of ſolemnities, a Tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down, nor one of the ſtakes be for ever removed, where the glorious Lord will be unto his a place of broad Rivers and Streams, to water the City of our God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh and make fat the Mountain of his Holineſs: Which things, as he hath foretold them in his Word, and will ſurely fulfill them in their ſeaſon; So let me ſay, THIS GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION SHAL NOT PASS TIL ALL THESE THINGS BE FULFILLED; for the time is at hand. He will finiſh the work, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs; Verily a ſhort work will the Lord make upon the earth.

                  <p>IT hath been oftentimes in my thoughts, that there is hardly any controverſie in this age (which is fruitful in little elſe) but there are in that thing wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie lyes, ſome <hi>more general principles</hi> of truth, which, as in their own nature they do carry a <hi>light</hi> round about them, ſo could they be found our, would in a few words <hi>inlighten</hi> a man more than all thoſe tedious Volumes, which, about things controverted, are daily ſent forth into the world, which ordinarily do but beat about the Buſh, never coming at the place where theſe <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> lye.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>care</hi> of that man who would make <hi>diſcovery of Truth,</hi> ſhould be in the firſt place, and above all, to <hi>ſearch</hi> theſe out, and having found them, to place them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for theſe being to be his foundation, if but a ſtone in this foundation, be either not of the true metal, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, it neceſſarily follows, that ſo much of the building, as hath it for its Baſis, muſt be weak or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried awry.</p>
                  <p>The beſt <hi>outward means</hi> to attain theſe <hi>principles,</hi> is to give attendance to the reading of the word, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to compare one place with another; but yet this may be done, and a man no whit the neerer, if with this endeavour there do not concur the inward ſupply and aſſiſtance of the Spirit. And truly I have many times thought with my ſelf, that as the great thing our faith is to have in its eye, when it goes to the Promiſe for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56286:233"/>is, That the Lord would lead us to theſe; ſo the principal thing in the Spirits teaching, when it teacheth any ſoul, is by its <hi>inward hints</hi> to point it unto theſe.</p>
                  <p>The moſt <hi>certain Character</hi> to know theſe <hi>principles</hi> by, when they are attained and when not, is an <hi>univerſal harmony</hi> of Truth; for theſe <hi>principles</hi> are as the Center, in which all the lines of Truth, which are ſeparated in the Circumſerence, do weet together, and become one point. But now, as the wider any Circumference is, the farther will a man be, who walks there, from the Center; So thoſe who travel in the large Circumference of mens Writings are farther from theſe <hi>principles,</hi> than thoſe, who ſhunning this broad way, betake themſelves to the narrow path of the Word alone. And it ſtands with reaſon it ſhould ſo be (though we had it not to ſay, This way is the way of the Promiſe) for the bringing forth of a <hi>Harmony,</hi> being by comparing one thing with another, a man may much better compare, where he hath much laid down in a little, as in the Word, than where hee hath little in much, as in the Writings of men; for as Judgement, Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are greatly holpen by the one ſo are they confounded by the other.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>principles</hi> are not without cauſe to be <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> which will not produce this <hi>Harmony:</hi> for Truth being one, and but one, ſo far as the creature cannot make it one, its a manifeſt Argument of his falling ſhort of the knowledge of Truth.</p>
                  <p>As it is ordinary for Gods people by <hi>inward hints</hi> to have firſt the <hi>light</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe <hi>principles,</hi> which followed up, will produce this <hi>outward Harmony,</hi> ſo muſt they in caſe they would walk ſafely, and make right concluſions, by this <hi>outward Harmony;</hi> judge of their <hi>inward hints. <hi>Hence</hi> inward hints</hi> are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to the <hi>fleighted,</hi> nor rably rejected, for of entimes they carry that with them, which were they followed up by thoſe that have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56286:233"/>them, would produce a glorious <hi>Harmony</hi> of Truth; Nor contrariwiſe are they to be <hi>credited,</hi> or received any further, than by this <hi>out ward Harmony,</hi> a teſtimony is given to them; for it is moſt certain, if the Spirit within be Teacher, he will make manifeſt the hidden myſteries of his voyce without, but never contradict them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>principles</hi> I am ſpeaking of, could they be <hi>found out,</hi> and brought to light, the <hi>way</hi> to Truth would bee <hi>ſhorter,</hi> the <hi>myſtery</hi> of Truth <hi>cleerer,</hi> the <hi>force</hi> of Truth to batter down Error, by how much it would be more united, <hi>greater,</hi> and a cloſe among the ſpirits of good men, ſooner attained, than is like to be in any other way. Withall, whoſoever would examine other mens <hi>principles</hi> upon any particular ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That I my ſelf have attained this knowledge, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, nor is it likely, ſeeing I am but uewly come unto this Leſſon; yet having made a diſcovery of ſuch a way, I am preſſing after it, and what I have attained, I offer to thee, Sober Reader, Read, and judge, and try if thou pleaſeſt.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56286:237"/>manifeſtation of his power and preſence, with, and among his people, and his ſtanding up in <hi>perſon,</hi> is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental miſtake in an enquiry of this nature; yea, confounds and darkens the whole truth (in a manner) of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and indeed is the very reaſon why ſome contend for a <hi>Spiritual appearance</hi> of Chriſt onely, <hi>viz.</hi> an appearance with his in a way of power, and others contrariwiſe for a <hi>Perſonal;</hi> whereas in both there is a glorious truth, and a ſet and an appointed time for both; onely the firſt falls ſo many years ſooner, and ſo is nearer to us; the ſecond ſo many later, and ſo is farther off; and poſſibly this may be one reaſon, why good people at this day harp ſo much upon the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neareſt to them, and ſo moſt upon their hearts.

                        <p>The 1290 <hi>days are to be begun Anno Dom.</hi> 366, with that noted act of <hi>Julian,</hi> of ſetting the <hi>Jews</hi> about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying the Temple, and furniſhing them out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury with all neceſſaries for this work, when by a terrible Earth quake all they built was thrown up, yea, the very foundation-ſtones of the Temple, which never till that day were moved, thrown out of their places, and by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Thunder and Lightning, and Fire falling from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all their tools and inſtruments were burnt up. So that as <hi>Socrates</hi> (in his third Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. according to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56286:238"/>the Greek, the 17. according to the Tranſlation) ſaith, <hi>That there a man might have beheld Hammers, Graving-Irons, Saws, Axes, Hatchets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>conſumed with fire; which fire</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ceaſed not to burn the ſpace of a whole day, and the</hi> Jews <hi>themſelves being amazed hereat, confeſſed Chriſt to be the omnipotent God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea farther (ſaith the aforeſaid Author) <hi>Cyril, then Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>when they began the work, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this Prophecy of</hi> Daniel, <hi>and urging Chriſts words with it,</hi> Matth. 24.2. <hi>did prophecy unto many, that now the time was come that our Saviours words ſhould be fulfilled, which he ſpake of the Temple, that</hi> not one ſtone ſhould be left upon another. Thus much out of the very words of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who wrote above 1200 years ago.</p>
                        <p>The truth of this act is alſo teſtified by many other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers; as</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who lived in the very time of <hi>Julian,</hi> and was a Souldier under him, <hi>lib.</hi> 23.</p>

                           <hi>Theodoret</hi> (who wrote his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 430.) <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Yea, which is alſo a thing very obſervable, and noted by <hi>Socrates,</hi> and moſt of the aforeſaid Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> That as wicked <hi>Julian</hi> did ſet the <hi>Jews</hi> upon re-edifying the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo did he alſo about the ſame time ſend his Legates to offer Sacrifice in the chief Heathen Temple of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in <hi>Delphos,</hi> and there to conſult with the Oracle of <hi>Apollo;</hi> and as God by Earth-quake, Thunder and Lightning did over-turn the one, ſo did he alſo in the ſame manner, and about that very time, the other; thereby overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at once both the cheif Temples, the one of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56286:239"/>he other of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> putting an end to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> daily Sacrifice, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Superſtitions, at one and the ſame time; and therefore no time may ſo fitly be called a time of Deſolation, and that becauſe of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as this.</p>
                        <p>Now the Reaſons why we are to fix the Head of our Account upon this act, rather than any other before it, or ſince it, are.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> if we begin with any act before it, the <hi>time is expired,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> not yet delivered, experience therefore proves ſuch beginnings falſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> we may not <hi>begin lower</hi> for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe</hi> if we begin lower, the 1290 days cannot be <hi>made concurrent in their end</hi> with <hi>Johns</hi> 1260. which for the fore-going grounds muſt be.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe Daniel</hi> being a Prophet of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the things he fore-told having a more <hi>eſpecial reſpect to that Nation,</hi> there cannot in any Hiſtory of any time ſince Chriſt be found an act ſo famous, and that with a relation to that Nation, as was this act of <hi>Julians,</hi> with which therefore we muſt begin, or none.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe</hi> no beginning lower (that will agree to <hi>Daniels</hi> words) either <hi>can be found,</hi> or is <hi>ſtated by any</hi> that ever yet I have met with; and it is a thing that I have much obſerved, how that all thoſe, who becauſe the time is near, and ſo little likelihood of any ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as yet, have not faith enough to beleeve this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, have alſo not light enough to make out another, but are ſilent, laying down no Head to begin this account up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet the Holy Ghoſt hath marked out, by as eminent and noted Characters, to ſhew us where we are to begin it, as any account in all the Scripture, verſ. 11. <hi>From the time that the daily Sacrifice ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, ſhall be</hi> 1290 <hi>days.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56286:239"/>
                        <p>And theſe Characters do moſt exactly agree to the act of <hi>Julian,</hi> as I have proved in my firſt part, pag. 52, 53. and indeed are not ſo fitly appliable to any act that ever was before or ſince it; I judge my ſelf therefore to have much reaſon ſtill to hold to that opinion, I then more doubtfully laid down, viz. That we are with <hi>Julians</hi> act of ſetting the Jews about re-edifying of the Temple, to begin the 1290 days.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon why I pitch upon the year <hi>three hundred ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fix,</hi> to be the year in which this was done (when as there is amongſt Hiſtorians three or four years variance in ſtating the year) is not this onely, becauſe Hiſtorians of beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count report this to be the year, and Authors of no little eſteem adhere rather to this report than any of the other; but my reaſon is, becauſe the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. (whoſe Head is the ſame with the one thouſand two hundred and ninety) cannot be made, as they muſt (as ſhall ſtraight-way appear) concurrent in their end with the two thouſand three hundred days, in caſe we fix this act of <hi>Julian</hi> upon any other year than the aforeſaid year three hundred ſixty ſix; that therefore I conclude (as formerly) to be the year; To three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty ſix, add one thouſand two hundred and ninety, the whole is one thouſand ſix hundred fitly ſix.</p>

Now this defection though it began and was in part more early, becauſe the myſtery of iniquity did work and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to thruſt it ſelf in, even from the Apoſtles daies, as <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For the myſtery of iniquity doth already work;</hi> yet did it not become eminent, ſo as that corruption began to have the Major Vote in Councils, and to be confirmed by their Decrees, till in and near about this year.

                        <p>Secondly, The <hi>riſe of the Antichriſtian Beaſt</hi> is there to <hi>be placed,</hi> where the ancient Roman Empire (which is that the Apoſtle tells us did then with-hold and let) <hi>began to fall to decay,</hi> and to be taken away, Verſ. 6, 7, 8. <hi>And now yee know what with-holdeth, that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his time.

Rom.</hi> the Empire was thereupon divided betwixt <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> his two Sons; ſo that the year 396. was the very firſt yeer of the diviſion of the Roman Empire. Now diviſion being the beginning of ruin, we may ſay there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the ruin of the Roman Empire, where it began ſo to be divided as never to be united more. Hence <hi>Dan.

                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56286:240"/>calls this the conſummate Diviſion, which did ſo diſtract the Empire now broken into two, as that it never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became united under one Emperor again. <hi>Par. in Medulla Hiſtoriae profanae.</hi>

                        <p>The thing I am ſpeaking of affords us a <hi>notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth of either beginning;</hi> for they muſt be ſo placed as that both Numbers may end together: by conſequence therefore the heads of either Number muſt be ſet at thirty years diſtance from each other; and in this diſtance too, the head of the 1290 muſt be by ſo many years the higher, and the head of the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty the lower, or elſe they cannot end together. Now is it not a thing very obſervable, that two things ſo remarkable, and made famous by ſo many Hiſtories, the one a thing ſo like the ſetting up of the Abomination of Deſolation, that no particular act recorded in any Hiſtory former or latter, doth more patly agree to <hi>Daniels</hi> words than this of <hi>Julian</hi> doth: The other a thing ſo like the riſe of the Beaſt, that we cannot, ſhould we ſearch Hiſtories over and over, find a time, which in all things will afford us more proper Characters than this doth, ſhould fall out at thirty years diſtance each from other? And alſo which is very obſervable in this diſtance too, that that which looks moſt like the 1290 dayes, the greater number by thirty years, ſhould be the higheſt, and that which looks moſt like the 1260 the loweſt? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this <hi>Harmony</hi> is not a thing <hi>accidental,</hi> but ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the All-wiſe Diſpoſer of times and ſeaſons, who through all the actions of the ſons of men carries on his own Deſigns, and performs his own eternal Will.</p>
                        <p>If either of theſe beginnings be diſallowed by any, let it by them be conſidered where they will find Heads, if not here, to begin theſe two Numbers upon, ſo as that the Harmony may not be broken, but either made from ſuch beginnings as they ſhall ſtate, to Terminate at the ſame point.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> as the 1335 days bring us to that time in which <hi>Daniel</hi> was to ſtand in his Lot, <hi>i. e.</hi> to riſe again, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.13. <hi>But go thou thy way till the end be, for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand up in thy lot</hi> (as our old tranſlation reads it) <hi>at the end of the days</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> at the end of the 1335 days mentioned in the foregoing Verſe, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould riſe) So the 2300 days brings us to the laſt end of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Ch.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Behold I will make thee know what ſhall be in the laſt end of indignation.</hi> And what is this laſt end of indignation, but only the laſt Vial of Gods wrath? <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. the pouring out of which is at the time of Chriſts coming, and the Reſurrection, as I have elſewhere proved at large.

                        <p>That <hi>the Heads of either number,</hi> (which yet both end at one and the ſame point) <hi>are ſo ſtated, as that the greater begins with the beginning of the Perſian Monarchy,</hi> and ſo with the Head of the Viſion it ſelf, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down quite through it; <hi>the leſſer not till near a</hi> 1000 <hi>years after,</hi> about the midſt of the Viſion, a little before the coming forth of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> is no leſs than the moſt glorious reſult of the wonderful wiſdom of the All-wiſe diſpoſer of all things, who for divers reaſons hath thought good ſo to order it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That <hi>hereby the Myſteries of theſe two Prophecies, yea, all</hi> Daniels <hi>Prophecies, might be the greater;</hi> for obſerve, there being not above three years betwixt either Viſion, <hi>Daniel</hi> having the firſt of theſe two, in the third of <hi>Belſhazzar, chap.</hi> 8.1. which year was the laſt of the

                        <p n="1">1 That <hi>either Prophecy were the ſame,</hi> and had one and the ſame beginning, and ending.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the <hi>thing ſpoken of the little horn,</hi> chap. 8. and of <hi>the vile perſon,</hi> chap. 11. <hi>were not to be applied to the time of</hi> Antiochus <hi>rage,</hi> (which very opinion hath been a cloud upon the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> for a long time) for as Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> in his <hi>Daniels Prophecies</hi> expounded, pag. 37. hath well proved, the 2300 days are no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to the time of <hi>Antiochus</hi> perſecutions.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That all <hi>Daniels Viſions, and Prophecies, viz.</hi> That of the great Image, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. That of the four Beaſts, and the little Horn, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. together with theſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 8, and <hi>chap.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>do terminate at one and the ſame point;</hi> and this point to be no other but the end of the 2300, the 1335 days; for if theſe two be the ſame, and terminate at one point, then by a parallel of reaſon, the other two alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the great Image, and that of the four Beaſts, for either of thoſe conclude with work of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and glory of a like kind with theſe. And if ſo, then is that other clouding opinion which darkens all <hi>Daniels Prophecies</hi> at this day, <hi>viz. That the little Horn,</hi> chap. 7. <hi>is to be underſtood either of the whole</hi> Norman <hi>Race
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56286:247"/>here in</hi> England <hi>from</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror, the firſt of that Race, as ſome conceive; or of the late King</hi> Charles <hi>onely, the laſt of that Race, as others,</hi> ſhaken off; for that Race hath been extirpated root and branch theſe five years already, whereas to the end of the 2300 days, the 1335, it is near 50 years yet to come; and therefore we muſt of neceſſity (unleſs we deny, that which from the ſcope of each <hi>Prophecy</hi> is ſo clear, as that it is undeniable, <hi>viz,</hi> that <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies have but one and the ſame end) conclude, that either the little Horn, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. is no ſuch thing, as many now adays ſuppoſe; or affirm, that the final deſtruction of this little Horn is come upon him upwards of fifty years, before the determined time. Now this one beam of light followed being ſuch, as that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers moſt of thoſe by-wayes that men have gone in, and thereby darkned the truth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> it could not, I ſay, ſtand with Gods deſign of ſealing this Book, to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of ſo great and clear light, as would have come in, had the heads of each number been placed with the time of each Viſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe hereby the latter Prophecy which is the clearer, and intended by the Lord as a farther, and more particular light into thoſe things, that in the general had been revealed before; ſhould have been as dark as the other, in regard of making up any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time, had the ſame began</hi> (as the other) <hi>from the time of the Viſion,</hi> for what is it that makes the 2300 days to be ſo hard to compute, but this, the ground we go upon to make up a right ſupputation of the years from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy</hi> until Chriſt, is more dark, perplexed, and uncertain; and therefore to find the vein of truth here, is a thing more hard; but now the 1335 dayes being begun (as before) with <hi>Julian,</hi> the very beginning it ſelf is below all the moſt difficult knots, and therefore the computation made thence more eaſie.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56286:247"/>
                        <p>Hence many have found the vein of truth, that runs from the Head of the 1335; but the vein of truth that runs from the Head of the 2300, I may truly and modeſtly ſay, hath not yet been found. And indeed, therefore God left that more clear, this more dark, becauſe the way of God, is to give his people firſt a little light, afterwards more; and alſo, becauſe that in the revelation of this light, that, after diſcovery might appear to be the greater light, which before diſcovery, was the thing moſt dark, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Reaſon. The Head of the 1335 is placed as it is, <hi>becauſe God in laying down that, had a ſpecial deſign at another thing,</hi> viz. <hi>To ſet up a light, to ſhew us thereby the riſing Beaſt,</hi> (as I obſerved before) and therefore it was moſt neceſſary it ſhould not be counted from the time of the Viſion, for then it could no way have ſerved ſuch an end; but rather ſhould be fixed as it is. Which fixation is ſuch, and ſo wonderful, that deny it, and no other fixation can be, which will, firſt make the 1290 days end with the 1260. And ſecondly, the 1335, with the 2300; both which muſt be for our fore-going reaſons, and by vertue of this fixation both are exactly performed, as in part we have ſeen already, and ſhall fully ſtreightway; And the number it ſelf alſo, hath as famous a Head for it ſelf, as any one number in Scripture. What admirable wiſdom therefore is there in appointing, and diſpoſing theſe heads as they are, <hi>viz.</hi> That the 2300 days ſhould begin where it doth, and the 1335 where it doth?</p>
                        <p>And indeed, were not the placing of the Head of the 1335 deſigned in the wonderful wiſdom of God, to be a Torch to give light to the time of the riſe of the Beaſt, we ſhould have no Scripture ground, but the bare report of Hiſtory (which leaves it ſo dubious as to many years, that we cannot, were we left to it alone, know certainly which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56286:248"/>to chuſe) to build upon for the time of the Beaſts riſe, and ſo conſequently of his ruin, though yet this is the great thing, and (as it were) the very hinge of all the principal Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptical Viſions.</p>

Seventy weeks are determined to anoint the moſt holy.

                        <p>It follows then that with the beginning of the year 1656, there are 2255 of <hi>Daniels</hi> 2300 years expired; the remaining years are only 45, which will expire, <hi>A.D.</hi> 1701, the very year in which <hi>Daniels</hi> 1335 dayes doth alſo expire.</p>

                        <p>The 2300 years ending (according to our former Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) at the ſame point with the 1335, is a <hi>good Argument to prove that our courſe by a good hand of Providence hath been ſteered aright, both as to the beginning of either number, and alſo the carrying on of this great number,</hi> for ſhould we ſeek after any other beginning of the 1335 dayes, then what we have before ſtated, the 1335 dayes could never be brought to end with the 2300. Or, in caſe the head of the 2300 dayes, were to be placed either higher or lower, or the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be made otherwiſe than what hath been laid down, then would not the 2300 dayes concur in their end with the 1335.

                        <p>The <hi>Harmony</hi> that is betwixt all thoſe Myſtical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers we have paſſed through, is <hi>a thing very glorious and admirable to behold;</hi> for there is not any one of them, but affords a beam of light to the other.

                        <p>Finally, as the beginning of the 1260, proves our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 1335 to be true, ſo our beginning of the 1335, proves the beginning of the 2300 to be true. And contrariwiſe, as the beginning of the 2300 proves the beginning of the 1335 to be true; ſo the beginning of the 1335, the beginning of the 1260 to be true. So that (which is glorious to conſider) the Myſtical Numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and having diverſe beginnings, yet have within themſelves ſuch an univerſal Harmony, that each one ſerves to inlighten the other, and the other him again.</p>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Daniel underſtood by Books</hi> the number of the years whereof the Lord had ſaid, He would accompliſh ſeventy years in the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem, he ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord by faſting, weeping, and mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> underſtood the time of the delivery of Gods people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be at hand, he not only <hi>ſtrengthned his Brethren, but took courage, and went in unto Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though it is far from entring into my thoughts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my ſelf with theſe, yet is it my duty, and deſire, to imitate them in their grace.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, my hearts deſire, and prayer to the Father of mercies is, That a <hi>Daniels praying Spirit</hi> might abound in my ſelf, and all the people of God at this day.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, my intents and purpoſes were to have cloſed up this diſcovery, with a <hi>ſolemn Exhortation;</hi> Firſt, To the Higher Powers of this Commonwealth. Secondly, To all thoſe who have fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, within it. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how poor and vain a thing the words of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, and how little, where much is ſpoken, reacheth the heart, if the Holy Spirit apply it not, in my after thoughts I judged it better to leave it to the Spirit of God to ſet home theſe truths, than to undertake to do it my ſelf; and therefore reſting in theſe thoughts, I ſhall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56286:254"/>only in a word or two deliver a Meſſage, and I hope not my own.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the Higher Powers, the Meſſage is this, THIS PEOPLE SAY, THE TIME IS NOT COME, <hi>the time that the Lords work ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on: Is it time for you (O yee) to dwell in your cieled houſes, and this work of Chriſt lye waſte? Now therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Conſider your wayes; Yea, thus ſaith the Lord, Conſider your wayes:</hi> For if at this time you lay aſide that work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the cauſe and glory of our dear and bleſſed Redeemer is ſo neerly, and immediately concerned, and attend to work of another nature, which comparatively he calls you not to, he will aſſuredly, in ſore diſpleaſure, with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, lay you aſide; ruine ſhall come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and deliverance unto Mount <hi>Sion</hi> another way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To the people of God in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the Meſſage is this, That although you are verily as unworthy a generation of Saints (conſidering how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal the profeſſion of ſome is, how looſe the Principles of others, how unlike Saints of old, yea Saints but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we are all) of this ſo great Grace, now ready to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as ever the earth bore: Yet that the whole world may ſee and know the exceeding riches of his grace, and that by the ſheddings abroad of his love (which is a way more ſuitable to Goſpel adminiſtrations) your over-grown corruptions may be rooted out, and the breaches of <hi>Sion</hi> made up, and you made to remember your own evill wayes and doings that were not good, and to loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his grace ſhall with a notwithſtanding triumph over all this your unworthineſs, and he will yet redeem his cauſe from the Grave, carry on his work among you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you and by you, as Inſtruments, gloriouſly and ſpeedily, yea with a high hand for his Name ſake.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56286:255"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, in particular to the Impriſoned Saints, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all thoſe who in this day ſuffer the reproaches of men, the ſcorn, and cenſures of Brethren, for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, and upon the account of his Kingdom, my Meſſage is, Your Brethren that hated you, and caſt you out for Chriſts name ſake, ſaid, <hi>LET THE LORD BE GLORIFIED,</hi> but he ſhall appear unto your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To all <hi>Sions</hi> Children whereſoever they may be, that take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the duſt thereof; let me ſay, Lift up your heads with joy, for your redemption draweth nigh: For yet a little while, and behold the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the Inhabitants of the earth for their Iniquity; when (as he hath purpoſed) he will ſtain the pride of all glory, and bring into contempt the honorable of the earth; For it is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the year of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for the controverſie of <hi>Sion.</hi> And though the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore begins now to ſay in her heart, I ſit as a Queen, am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow, yet ſhall her plagues come upon her in one day, death, and mourning, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord our God, that judgeth her.</p>
